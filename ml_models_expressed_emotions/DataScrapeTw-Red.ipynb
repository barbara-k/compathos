And then covid, person sneezing passes virus on! \\n@spencerdenham : @BourgaultGilles @Perseph31450988 @aus_drew @MattHopkins_au Oh and please name a few more? Let’s look at the virus H1N1(Spanish flu)  killed 50million in 1918. Killed 200k people in 2009 and 44 deaths in 2021, a four year low!! Hmmmm millions to less than 100.. yeah definitely deadlier 🤣🤣.

Both where harmless to human until mutation.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/B2s7WkKD82 \\n@spencerdenham : @BourgaultGilles @Perseph31450988 @aus_drew @MattHopkins_au I did comment about Spanish flu, H1N1!

It is direct contact with bodily fluids and the clue to which bodily fluid is most likely to infect is in its name ‘Hemorrhagic fever’. \\n@spencerdenham : @BourgaultGilles @Perseph31450988 @aus_drew @MattHopkins_au And what virus did the 2009 H1N1 have its origins in??? \\n@BourgaultGilles : @DevineSpeak @yates_brit @catfish8888 @MattHopkins_au It more, there is a new team, and you say that you dislike it by using anti-sport argument. \\n@BourgaultGilles : @spencerdenham @Perseph31450988 @aus_drew @MattHopkins_au We talking about virus do mutate to become more deadly. \\n@BourgaultGilles : @spencerdenham @Perseph31450988 @aus_drew @MattHopkins_au 1500BC, flu virus. They all from that virus. \\n@spencerdenham : @BourgaultGilles @Perseph31450988 @aus_drew @MattHopkins_au Well covid hasn’t so that destroys your theory!! \\n@spencerdenham : @BourgaultGilles @Perseph31450988 @aus_drew @MattHopkins_au 1918 Spanish flu virus which mutated infected pigs and became…swine flu. You’ve learnt something now about mutagens.. welcome to the lesson! \\n@BourgaultGilles : @spencerdenham @Perseph31450988 @aus_drew @MattHopkins_au Beta and Delta was more deadly that Alpha. 🤷\\u200d♂️ \\n@BourgaultGilles : @spencerdenham @Perseph31450988 @aus_drew @MattHopkins_au No, it is not Spanish flu who mutate in pig.

The burden is on you, are you one of those lazy Karen? \\n@spencerdenham : @BourgaultGilles @Perseph31450988 @aus_drew @MattHopkins_au Because it might actually teach you something. As a scientist I know how to do research, maybe you should try👍 \\n@DevineSpeak : @BourgaultGilles @yates_brit @catfish8888 @MattHopkins_au I really thought you\\'d get the analogy....🤦\\u200d♀️ Ok, so how do you explain the vaccine injured being called antivax when they have the audacity to request assistance for their injuries? Yes it happened, just read the articles about the Silent No More petition to Parliament. \\n@wendyreierson : @Fledglinggood @MattHopkins_au My children were born in the 70’s and I have their vaccine records.  We kept them on their baby books. \\n@Fledglinggood : @wendyreierson @MattHopkins_au We didn’t have blue books or parental copies in Australia until 1996. Perhaps some people opted for written records, however most will rely on information which may not be available or hard to find. \\n@Fledglinggood : @wendyreierson @MattHopkins_au If the find the records, you can have them added to your Medicare immunisation report. It can be much easier to get a comprehensive antibody report. Cover everything in one go… as immunisation could be given in multiple locations, such as schools, GP clinics, pharmacy. \\n@Fledglinggood : @wendyreierson @MattHopkins_au I have a suspicion that I wasn’t given many immunisations. Anyway, my antibody report didn’t raise any concerns in 2002. \\n@Fledglinggood : @wendyreierson @MattHopkins_au I don’t remember having chicken pox, but I do remember having the measles. The virus itself. I don’t remember whether I got vaccinated or not. \\n@Fledglinggood : @wendyreierson @MattHopkins_au They had this attitude my parents, that if you didn’t make it for some reason, it’s nature way of removing a fault. I don’t know if I agree with it… but they put you to the test and then say “All my kids survive” as if they have this kind of power. \\n@Fledglinggood : @wendyreierson @MattHopkins_au When I was sick I still had to go to school and if complained or looked a bit too unwell, he still took me to work. You had to be ear death to be considered sick. They are hard people sometimes. They don’t want us to get too pampered or comfortable. \\n@Fledglinggood : @wendyreierson @MattHopkins_au Now they are complaining about people. You can’t have your cake and eat it too. Who was the number one defender of climate and Earth in the olden days? He this Khan. He killed a lot of people. I’m not afraid of the truth. Don’t play games.. what’s the go? \\n@BourgaultGilles : @DevineSpeak @yates_brit @catfish8888 @MattHopkins_au For be vaccine injured, you need be vaccinated. 🤷\\u200d♂️ \\n@drajm : Where we are at with #covid, where we are going, and how we are getting there are all not ok.\\n\\nWe need a vaccines PLUS strategy. Agile vaccines. Clean air, masks &amp; good antiviral access.\\n\\nAnything less gives us more disease, disability, &amp; deaths, esp for the vulnerable groups. \\n@Naylor007 : @drajm I\\'m starting to feel a little broken by the failure of Gov/people to undertake basic protections for themselves &amp; others (either by way of ignorance, or selfishness). It\\'s really starting to feel like we\\'ve just given up. Taking the \\'what will be, will be approach\\'. \\n@AlexAlDaly : @Naylor007 @drajm No, people are waking up that it was all hype and fear. There was no pandemic! Surely you can see that for yourself 2 plus years on! \\n@AlexAlDaly : @SusieRoxStar @drajm @AlboMP @AnnastaciaMP @MarkMcGowanMP @YvetteDAth @AustralianLabor Good to see that there are still fools who believe there’s a ‘pandemic’ because they were told there is. Wake up! \\n@SusieRoxStar : @AlexAlDaly @drajm @AlboMP @AnnastaciaMP @MarkMcGowanMP @YvetteDAth @AustralianLabor I have spent a lot of time in hospitals over the past 4 months.

Sit down you buffoon. \\n@AmandaWilks9 : @DrRanj So glad I had my vaccines \\n@AmandaWilks9 : @MrD_ESC @DrRanj I’ve had 3 vaccines and very recently contracted Covid for the first time… so glad I was vaccinated. Definitely not a conspiracy - why would we cause so much from financial deficit globally? \\n@hillpatt : @Kevin40383097 @DrRanj The same itchy skin \\n@martinjay94 : @JayEdwardsuk @DrRanj How do you know it’s the vaccination that’s causing it, rather than Covid itself? \\n@MrD_ESC : @AmandaWilks9 @DrRanj But how do you know the vaccine helped?? Omicron is very mild for the vast majority of people? The vaccine has no immunity after just a few months. Again not a conspiracy but also not the necessity it’s been made into. \\n@gkarver : @TommyRocker260 @DrRanj Here’s some data out of Washington state.  Do you have a peer reviewed study to share that shows they don’t prevent hospitalization and death? Or do you just share baseless statements?\\n\\nhttps://t.co/iI0Jy6fiC1 \\n@martinjay94 : @JayEdwardsuk Do they test daily? If not how do you know this. \\n@martinjay94 : @JayEdwardsuk How many people are we talking whose bad fits and clots? \\n@martinjay94 : @JayEdwardsuk Many, but you know all their testing routines and none apparently had Covid. Interesting. \\n@martinjay94 : @JayEdwardsuk I don\\'t believe you, I don\\'t know anyone whose had adverse reactions due to the vaccines, but you know \"many\". And none of these have had COVID, even though 70% have had COVID. \\n@martinjay94 : @JayEdwardsuk You\\'re the one whose been tweeting a doctor about vaccines, even though you have no background in medical and basing it on hear say.

You are tweeting a Doctor, and you have no medical background. \\n@gkarver : @TommyRocker260 @DrRanj Ok, so official government hospitalization data is not valid enough for you to show that the vaccines prevent death and hospitalization, but YELP! reviews (sorry, VAERS) is to be more trusted? Are those considered peer reviewed?  Those numbers are pure hyperbole. \\n@TommyRocker260 : @gkarver @DrRanj Sooo, the governments own figures are pure hyperbole 🤔..Oh wait.....does that mean the CDC are the conspiracy theorists now. 🤦\\nStay boosted my friend. \\n@gkarver : @TommyRocker260 @DrRanj It’s basically YELP! for the CDC. You don’t think the FDA and CDC would have stepped in already if they felt these claims were valid and worrisome? I’m guessing you gave the vaccines 1 ⭐️ and a negative review.

Mum (me) stayed in different location, due to high risk at the time. \\n@AnnaWhateley : @astred And you hadn’t already got it, just a bit late? I’m not sure if I’m doomed anyway - having shared food and drink etc \\n@chaotic_kat : @AnnaWhateley Answered on behalf of my spouse, who stayed negative the 12 days my child and I tested positive. We both wore masks when in shared spaces, ate outside, slept in seperate rooms with doors closed + HEPAs running + open windows. HEPAs running in shared spaces through daytime. \\n@chaotic_kat : @AnnaWhateley We all the slept in same room the night before we tested positive. Kiddo and dad played together indoors in the morning, before I decided to test. \\n\\nExposure levels (i.e. how\\'s much virus you are exposed to) affect risk of infection and how sick you could get. All is not lost. \\n@chaotic_kat : @AnnaWhateley We followed the instructions &amp; guidance linked on https://t.co/yFwfsQiaPe for how to isolate in a shared living space. \\n@AnnaWhateley : @chaotic_kat Thank you so much! I’ve had two positive kids without sharing further than that,, but they were teenagers.. totally different as they could reliably mask. I’ll check out the web site too 🙏 \\n@AnnaWhateley : Also excuse the typo and omg did I mention my 9yo has covid?!?! 😭😵\\u200d💫 \\n@MelissaGijsbers : @AnnaWhateley I masked when they came into communal areas. Kept windows open &amp; cleaned anything they touched. Kids isolated in their room &amp; we have a separate bathroom &amp; toilet just for covid positive ppl. No one else got covid! If we couldn\\'t open windows, would have done more masking \\n@MelissaGijsbers : @AnnaWhateley Sending hugs to the kid &amp; the rest of the family \\n@MelissaGijsbers : @AnnaWhateley I left food outside the bedroom door, knocked &amp; left, then they opened the door (masked) to pick it up. Minimal contact. Wasn\\'t easy to do. Poor kid has it again now, but doesn\\'t live at home any more (I\\'m still dropping off food &amp; meds) \\n@BlindGrlMusings : @AnnaWhateley ah please take care. sending loads of love.\\nhoping for a smooth recovery \\n@AnnaWhateley : @MelissaGijsbers Thanks Melissa.

I hope my other two don’t get it again too \\n@AnnaWhateley : @BlindGrlMusings Thank you xx \\n@urhein : @AnnaWhateley Contracted it, but didn\\'t really do any attempts to avoid it.

At 5 I probably would have been similar?? \\n@astred : @AnnaWhateley No kid was the only one to get it. I was in hospital overnight, kid was a bit tired day I went to hospital, tested + next day. Husband shared two little rooms with kid for 10 days. Both masked, windows open and air purifiers on. Only kid had it. No coughing tho, just sniffles \\n@AnnaWhateley : @astred What an epic time 😩💖 \\n@ewaeramsey : @AnnaWhateley 8yo came into our room and slept between us for two hours, got up, said he didn’t want to go to school so I RATed him and he was positive. I figured the infection horse had bolted, so we didn’t mask. 10yo he shares a room tested positive the next day, adults didn’t get it 🤷\\u200d♀️ \\n@AnnaWhateley : @ewaeramsey 😵\\u200d💫😵\\u200d💫😵\\u200d💫 \\n@ewaeramsey : @AnnaWhateley I ended up getting it a few weeks later from somewhere else, and my husband didn’t get it from me then either, despite sharing a room. It seems very random. Wishing you good immunity and hoping your 9yo isn’t too poorly 🤞 \\n@ksimpsonbooks : @AnnaWhateley Going through this at the moment. Kept kid 1 in a separate room. She masked to leave the room e.g. for bathroom, we masked if we went in. I still got it but I wonder if I caught it before I knew she had it. My mum lives in another house and caught it from her before symptoms. \\n@ksimpsonbooks : @AnnaWhateley Kid 2 caught it from me or kid 1 despite the same procedure and now my partner is the only one negative. We\\'ve turned his room into iso room and the rest of us are sharing Covid house. \\n@urhein : @AnnaWhateley To be honest, for me it was more like \"alright, let\\'s get this over with\", so I personally wouldn\\'t have done anything differently if she was 9. But I\\'m low-risk and wasn\\'t really worried, anyway, so ymmv. \\n@ksimpsonbooks : @AnnaWhateley Sorry your kid has covid. 😭😭😭 \\n@AnnaWhateley : @ksimpsonbooks Ah you’ve really been through the tag game. I shared a car for two hours with my son when he then tested positive. Also shared two hours home again with masks on and still didn’t get it?! But he was older and keeps himself quite contained. 9yo does not. She also can’t isolate 🤷\\u200d♀️ \\n@astred : @AnnaWhateley Yeah it was super shit - I stayed in a hotel for 10 days and did post op recovery alone. Booooo \\n@ksimpsonbooks : @AnnaWhateley It\\'s such a tricky one. We decided it was worth it to at least try. I would try again next time. \\n@beyondbeeton : @AnnaWhateley Didn’t mask, but avoided direct contact, ventilated house. 1 out of 2 parents got covid. \\n@belindamgrant : @AnnaWhateley So sorry Anna \\n@AnnaWhateley : @urhein I’m high risk, ish, it’s complicated. \\n@AnnaWhateley : @astred That’s just so horrible!

I’ve been cursing myself for finishing what was, admittedly, a lovely danish 😅 \\n@Josh_B_Rosner : @AnnaWhateley @sandybarker My 9 yo &amp; my husband both had it a couple of weeks ago. I didn’t wear a mask in the house, was around them both - in fact, child lay on my chest coughing and spluttering for 3 days - and didn’t get it. Somehow. \\n@beyondbeeton : @AnnaWhateley Danishes *are* lovely! What will be, will be…in our house the parent who did bedtime (with a closed door) is the one who got it. I feel like ventilation is key. There was no parent-parent transmission either. \\n@AnnaWhateley : @Josh_B_Rosner @sandybarker Wow, that must have been rough 😔 \\n@Josh_B_Rosner : @AnnaWhateley @sandybarker Relatively mild and passes quickly for Miss 9.

The girls are back to school now so we\\'ll see. \\n@drhelenedwards : @AnnaWhateley So sorry to hear...we isolated 13 yr old in room. Opened all windows all day. Kept all internal doors shut. All Wore masks in shared zone/bathroom. I Glen20d doors etc after he went to bathroom. I went in a few times a day to check him, take food etc Nobody else got it \\n@kmjgardiner : @AnnaWhateley Sorry the little one is crook! Hope it\\'s not too horrible. Xx \\n@drhelenedwards : @AnnaWhateley Also, he home schooled the day before &amp; sat near me all day unmasked. He vomited all over his room that night, so clearly infectious. So early exposure but still didn\\'t get it thank you to 4x vax \\n@AnnaWhateley : @drhelenedwards I’m glad you stayed clear. My teens were happy to isolate, but poor 9yo just won’t cope emotionally so I’ll be masks and doors open today I think. \\n@AnnaWhateley : @kmjgardiner Thanks Kelly. I’m glad we have books - maybe time to count and see if we make a formal library? 1000? \\n@kmjgardiner : @AnnaWhateley Excellent project. Will also require a major methodology discussion. Alphabetical? \\n@AnnaWhateley : @kmjgardiner Many bookshelves, each with their own system.

Today has been a living hell of endless barking, lawn equipment, beep trucks, screaming kids. I feel utterly disoriented.\\n\\nAnyone going through similar w/ #LongCovid ?? \\n@earthgranola : @catladyactivist Yes, I have a friend who is experiencing this. Hers comes with a flash of anger. Odd but there is a correlation. She couldn’t taste or smell with her Covid infection \\n@DFortais : @earthgranola @catladyactivist That describes me plus I cannot take being in the sun or heat anymore.  It has been over 90 for weeks on end and I have to hide indoors or feel like my skin is on fire and feel ill. \\n@SassyIsMe1961 : @catladyactivist Some days yes loud sounds really bother me. It’s the excruciating daily headaches that are wearing me down. But my list of problems is long. Two damaged heart valves, anaphylaxis are the worst of things. #LongCovid \\n@catladyactivist : @earthgranola Sound triggering anger/rage is usually misophonia. \\n@cutejewelryst : @catladyactivist My headache disorders do similar. It\\'s definitely a neurological thing. Noise, light, certain smells give me stabbing pain or pounding headaches. My sister always had misophonia, and we didn\\'t know-I spent my childhood knowing she wanted to strangle me for \"breathing loud\" 🤯 \\n@earthgranola : @DFortais @catladyactivist I’ll have to ask her about that. She has mentioned it’s been hot as of late. Covid is an odd virus. I fully believe these things are related \\n@cutejewelryst : @catladyactivist It was such a relief to learn a few years ago that it was a real disorder that some people have. \\n@catladyactivist : @cutejewelryst As new information emerges about misophonia, it\\'s becoming clear that it affects a lot more people than previously thought. It\\'s very real and not uncommon. I don\\'t think humans (or any creatures) were made to absorb the amount of noise that it in most of our modern environments. \\n@earthgranola : @catladyactivist She’s always had that slightly, but it’s gone through the roof since her infection. Used to be people eating ect, now it’s anything that is loud. Very disorienting for her \\n@catladyactivist : @earthgranola Yes! Disorienting is a good word. It literally shuts me down to all other things except that noise and I am capable of absolutely nothing but self-defense until it stops. \\n@cutejewelryst : @catladyactivist 💯 We had construction on the adjoining townhouse during the height of the pandemic, everything from jackhammers to guys hammering all day long. 3 months of very loud stuff. I was miserable, headaches all the time...the cats were miserable...My husband was the only one unaffected \\n@cutejewelryst : @catladyactivist I don\\'t understand how construction workers live like that. None were even wearing noise cancelling headphones etc. \\n@earthgranola : @catladyactivist That’s her. It’s become so bothersome she’ll stay up late (3 am) getting things done. There is minimal ‘noise violence’ as she calls it. \\n@catladyactivist : @earthgranola Noise violence is SPOT ON. Feels like an assault on the senses. I get up before the sun does to have peace and stabilize before it all begins. \\n@catladyactivist : @SassyIsMe1961 What this virus does to people is horrifying. And we still don\\'t know the full scope of it. Meanwhile, they\\'re just letting it rip. \\n@SassyIsMe1961 : @catladyactivist We long Covids have been over looked from the get go. \\n@LaurieMeberg : @catladyactivist @earthgranola I find also people who talk loudly and almost never stop to take a breath. Their presence becomes triggering too. \\nNeed lots of margin to decompress after the fact. \\n@earthgranola : @catladyactivist Px touch has become very bothersome too. She can’t stand being touched or accidentally bumped. It’s an odd feeling/pain. Have you experienced this? \\n@catladyactivist : @earthgranola I\\'ve always had a serious aversion to being touched. Even my cats rubbing  against my legs makes me crazy. My husband playfully, very gently patted my butt one day and I jumped so violently (reflex to touch) that I blew a disc in my back out. I cannot do surprise touch at ALL. \\n@earthgranola : @catladyactivist Dang, that is quite a reflex. She’s like you being touch adverse, but nothing to the degree she is now.  It’s as if a sensory overload. She even tested to see if she was on the spectrum. Was a solid no. Something changed after Covid. \\n@earthgranola : @LaurieMeberg @catladyactivist Interesting. That would be difficult to avoid. \\n@KaiaMindelen : @catladyactivist Leaf blowers cause my inner abdominal/ torso parts to feel like they are having a massive &amp; continuous earthquake. \\n@catladyactivist : @KaiaMindelen I can deeply relate! \\n@TheExtraFiles : @catladyactivist Tonight I had to take meds, wear ice hat..no light and headphones.\\nThe worst for me is barking and kids bickering..many sounds are horrible with my constant headaches that usually turn into daily migraines mixed with nausea and vertigo. I feel the sound all over me. Hate it! \\n@TheExtraFiles : @catladyactivist When I was younger I use to tell my family their voices would make my back hurt.. I had pneumonia pretty badly when I was a toddler..I think I had issues from then.\\nNow I feel a lot in my chest.\\nThe sound and light issues have been w/ me since March 2020. \\n@TheExtraFiles : @catladyactivist It has gotten better than it was.. but still struggle.\\nHope yours diminish over time. \\n@catladyactivist : @TheExtraFiles Hard relate. I have 7 dogs &amp; an illegal breeder in my immediate area. The barking can be brutal. Hours at a time. Loud for anyone\\'s perception so excruciating for me. I literally feel their barks. It\\'s like being hit repeatedly w/electricity. After a while I get dizzy, nauseated. \\n@TheExtraFiles : @catladyactivist Exactly.

It’s the CDC’s job to provide accurate, scientific information about the hazards of Covid and the measures needed to contain it — and let the public decide how it wants to proceed. That’s not happening. \\n@TheLemurGuy : @mskathleenquinn @myrabatchelder To be fair, the WH didn\\'t lift the airline mask requirement. A federal judge did. One appointed by the party that is now out of power. \\n\\nMy guess is the WH decided fighting it up to the very conservative SCOTUS was not worth it, because they\\'d likely lose when they got there. \\n@TheLemurGuy : @mskathleenquinn @myrabatchelder To your other point~ we already had 2.5 years of democratic discussion about Covid. The result is our current policy, which is \\'back to normal\\' most places, an expression of the will of the majority. May or may not be the smart move, but that is democracy in action. \\n@MarkedByCovid : @myrabatchelder That\\'s why we need a FULL accounting of the decisions made that resulted in the deaths of our loved ones.\\n\\nDemand a comprehensive investigation with us: https://t.co/L2jTMPWGLC \\n@mskathleenquinn : @TheLemurGuy @myrabatchelder You’re right and what I should have said regarding Delta’s pressure to get guidance changed was regarding return-to-work guidance.  I am going to take issue with the notion we’ve had democratic debate regarding Covid. To put it mildly, in 2020 the public was led to believe that&gt; \\n@mskathleenquinn : @TheLemurGuy @myrabatchelder 2&gt;dealing with Covid would mean a short period of altering routines, that Covid was seasonal and soon to disappear or transform into the sniffles, and that vaccines that prevented transmission were within reach by the end of the year. The public was never presented with a &gt; \\n@mskathleenquinn : @TheLemurGuy @myrabatchelder 3/clear distinction between investing in an all-out effort to control community transmission or “learning to live with virus”. The entire debate was pre-dismissed as “too late” and the public was never consulted. The public was encouraged to drop masks and other protections etc&gt; \\n@mskathleenquinn : @TheLemurGuy @myrabatchelder 4/Really, it would be a very long tweet thread to re-hash every critical turning point over the past 2.5 years whereby people who always thought infection prevention was ridiculous and unattainable led the people into accepting infection as “inevitable”. Contrast this with&gt; \\n@mskathleenquinn : @TheLemurGuy @myrabatchelder 5/the very transparent, informed discussion in New Zealand about Covid policy. I don’t think such a discussion is impossible in the US  and could be begun at any time. In fact, as Covid disables more and more people I expect, absent sterilising vaccines, that debate  will arrive. \\n@mskathleenquinn : @TheLemurGuy @myrabatchelder 6/The public was and is asked to simply ”trust” in leaders and scientists promising herd immunity, vaccines that mean no more need for masks, Covid is “over”, Covid is like the flu, soon we’ll have 0 deaths (despite no infection prevention). That’s not democratic decision making. \\n@Shelli_Rosen : @myrabatchelder It’s an ill-conceived strategy to prevent backlash against Dems for being the party of covid restrictions to undercut attempts by R’s to exploit the issue. That they also undermine science, their credibility, truth, people’s lives &amp; public health is mere collateral damage. \\n@myrabatchelder : @Shelli_Rosen It\\'s a ridiculous strategy when most Democrats support COVID prevention efforts! \\n\\nDemocrats seem to forget voters are living through the pandemic and many have lost loved ones, are struggling with #LongCOVID, and are being forced into unsafe workplaces. \\n@TheLemurGuy : @mskathleenquinn @myrabatchelder Isn’t a simpler explanation just that politicians are reacting to what they perceive as the will of their constituents? Majority wanted pre-pandemic normal back and a political party against restoring that is going to be out of work after the next election. \\n@Francophile_66 : @myrabatchelder Get the feeling she isn\\'t offering much resistance though, with all her treacly bs about children making fun of others for wearing a mask. Notice she and Ja seem to be working remotely. She herself lives in a bubble and seems to make no effort to really serve the public. \\n@TheLemurGuy : @mskathleenquinn @myrabatchelder To take it to an even more basic equation: the number of people who still want restrictions is low enough that politicians do not need to care about their take to win. That’s reality. Again, not saying that is right or wrong but it’s where we are regardless of how we got there. \\n@myrabatchelder : @Francophile_66 True. See thread below. https://t.co/EbcsECSKG6 \\n@TheLemurGuy : @mskathleenquinn @myrabatchelder I’ll also say I’d much rather have the current crew in charge than Trump. Biden will at least do some things. GOP would be doing literally nothing right now. I dunno, maybe I’m a make lemonade when you have lemons kind of guy. \\n@mskathleenquinn : @TheLemurGuy @myrabatchelder You’ve made many interesting points to which I will overall say that it is actually very hard to determine the answers, especially once you realize how extremely varied and fragmented America is, and that all of us (including politicians) form our ideas via media. Having worked&gt; \\n@mskathleenquinn : @TheLemurGuy @myrabatchelder 2/years in Big Influence media,  I can tell you as you already know what the publlc believes or thinks is a very dynamic thing, with a lot of fog blowing in both directions. On some specific points you raise, the intense human desire to return to a pre-pandemic life is not the&gt; \\n@mskathleenquinn : @TheLemurGuy @myrabatchelder 3&gt;same as wanting the removal of protections. Hundreds of millions of Americans never wanted anyone in their family to get Covid. You really can’t discount the impact on people being told they didn’t need protections when they actually did. \\n@mskathleenquinn : @TheLemurGuy @myrabatchelder 4&gt;Finally, it is hard to predict what initiatives GOP would back if they saw it to their political advantage. We already saw the willingness to massively fund vax development, and then to make populist promises to fund and distribute Regeneron. I would argue, in fact, that&gt; \\n@mskathleenquinn : @TheLemurGuy @myrabatchelder 5/we watched the Biden Admin shamefully drag its feet on continuing to fund new vax researh and treatments precisely because Operation Warp Speed was a Trump ”success” and because Ron DeSantis pushed loudly for treatments.  There are a million reasons not to want the GOP&gt; \\n@mskathleenquinn : @TheLemurGuy @myrabatchelder 6&gt;in power, but the sensitiviety to populist clamor and a perhaps better understanding of the havoc Covid is creating economically is… interesting. The blue techno-elite who turned tail on Covid, in fear of the GOP and for their own blinkered privilege, has behaved abominably. \\n@myrabatchelder : So the US has really just given up and is saying we have to accept hundreds of thousands more people dying from #COVID, millions more becoming disabled by #LongCOVID, and those of us at higher risk just have to stay at home for forever? That\\'s the effing plan?!?! \\n@eyesontheflies : @myrabatchelder I can\\'t say for sure but I have a feeling people aren\\'t going to stand for another round of this shit. Esp young people. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if  school and work walkouts start up. \\nThere\\'s gotta be something we can do to make it clear we\\'re not okay with being expendable \\n@myrabatchelder : Calling my electeds &amp; demanding they take action. I refuse to accept the rest of my life I will be trapped in my home because our government refuses to do their fucking job and take action. There are TONS of policies that can be put in place to help stop community transmission. \\n@myrabatchelder : I encourage everyone out there to call and email their electeds! Those of us that want to stay alive and not keep getting infected and reinfected by COVID need to speak out! \\n\\nIf I lived in MA, I would go protest outside Walensky and Jha\\'s house.

Probably not 100% IRL but damn close. https://t.co/5p5bG1KaGP \\n@HygieneJones : @myrabatchelder Just because public health is too dumb(CDC admitted this yesterday) doesn\\'t mean you have to be also. https://t.co/TNw4KOFj1T\\nInfection starts in the nose... address it in the nose. So listening to idiots in gov &amp; public health.  https://t.co/g841yRsYMJ \\n@JennyOrosel : @ebshred @myrabatchelder @KristeKline The new variants have a huge amount of immune escape. Its no longer the \"pandemic of the unvaccinated\". \\n@linfzh : @myrabatchelder It’s not about giving up. It’s about accepting reality. COVID is not going away no matter what we do. And we aren’t gonna mask forever. Accept it or keep living in denial. It’s your choice \\n@cookie25fammv : @linfzh @myrabatchelder You are wrong.  You\\'re the one who has given up.  If you won\\'t try to do any mitigation, then you fully accept the flight cancellations, supply chain shortages, intermittent school/daycare closures that go with uncontrolled disease spread.  It\\'s your new normal. \\n@cookie25fammv : @HygieneJones @myrabatchelder Unless it enters your body through your eyes. \\n@ebshred : @JennyOrosel @myrabatchelder @KristeKline That is true…. \\n@SanityorVanity : @eyesontheflies @myrabatchelder In theory, it sounds plausible. But in my experience, it takes a whole lot for people to decide they\\'re going to walk out of school or work. It\\'s the kind of thing that\\'s rare here. Americans are likely to put up with a whole lot of unfairness until they finally get fed up enough \\n@aniceknight0031 : @myrabatchelder Not exactly. We\\'ve decided a coherent pandemic response is expensive, bad for the stock market and elites can afford good drugs...so we\\'re going to play \"let\\'s pretend\" and let society\\'s most vulnerable and poorest shoulder the burden of it - just like we do with everything else. \\n@SusieRoxStar : @myrabatchelder This is Australia’s plan, too. The leaders are letting people die. \\n@ebshred : @myrabatchelder @KristeKline I agree. I have to say when the Covid virus first hit, it was the Delta variant. Then it mutated. It mutated bc it had no problem finding hosts as it it infected those who were (&amp; still remain?) unvaxxed. In the Swiss Cheese Model, that seems like a big hole that kept lining up. \\n@eyesontheflies : @SanityorVanity @myrabatchelder I agree. I just feel like things are reaching a boiling point. Maybe it\\'s just me trying to hold onto whatever hope I have left but something feels different this time around. \\n@doescomputing : @cookie25fammv @linfzh @myrabatchelder Needs nuance. All medical interventions should be proven effective. Somehow with C19 this precedence changed and was no longer true for the most prominent “mitigations” like mask mandates.\\n\\nHalf-assed policies that can’t be fully supported are ineffective and fuel mistrust. \\n@cookie25fammv : @doescomputing @linfzh @myrabatchelder A lot can be done without \"mandates\".  Public education regarding everything from handling stds to wearing seat belts have had an impact.  Over the decades, the public opinion regarding impaired driving has changed in this country. \\n@people_NOTcorps : @aniceknight0031 @myrabatchelder And not just the poorest, but the vast majority, the middle class, and all but the top income bracket. The most craven, sociopathic, self centered group, who is also prone to bullying, let\\'s let them survive, and everyone else, we don\\'t care. Cannon fodder equivalent for the rich \\n@doescomputing : @cookie25fammv @linfzh @myrabatchelder Agreed, and this is where public health messaging failed miserably. Doing it right requires nuance and taking the time and effort to build trust. Instead experts opted for the short-sighted lazy all-or-nothing policy to shame and coerce compliance, which fueled mistrust in PH. 😑 \\n@cookie25fammv : @doescomputing @linfzh @myrabatchelder I\\'ve felt for awhile that the CDC does not really understand human behavior. \\n@aniceknight0031 : @people_NOTcorps @myrabatchelder in accuracy I should point out that most of the middle class people I know are getting paxlovid which the world health organization has endorsed. treatment with it runs about $500 - pretty trivial for most people with jobs, utterly unattainable for people in developing countries \\n@PoliticalAvengr : MSNBC - Bayer Mass Murder Exposed (HIV Contaminated Vaccine) https://t.co/rGEMRA1wyM #Vaccines #Unvaxxed #unvaccinated #populationcontrol \\n@GaryGoodson17 : @PoliticalAvengr Worse than rats.

This mask-user believes that an immunocompromised person must be taking unnecessary risks to get it 4X. On the other hand, some think once you had #COVID, you won’t get it again.

But we don’t know why. They can’t study what they don’t want to understand. I don’t get it. Some people can’t do penicillin. So they found alternatives. We can’t do some vax.

My friend who dropped dead a few weeks after 2nd shot at age 61 . No heart issues found til after 1st shot. Better research would have let her know not to get the 2nd shot injury denial killed her. \\n@Dem4FreeSpeech : @shivvy888 @angryhacademic So both covid and shots without enough research are harmful and have caused pain. That Covid can kill does or make it okay to be careless about vaccine safety or ignore issues and not try to reduce vax injury. We need to reduce Covid death and vax injury. \\n@Dem4FreeSpeech : @Irene73723559 @shivvy888 @angryhacademic So sorry.

Appliance is in the basement. Since I do not run central air am I good just sealing door and opening basement &amp; main floor windows? Basement door goes directly outside so that helps. \\n@smaragdhi : @catladyactivist I believe so. Make sure there\\'s no route air in the basement can come up to the house. \\n@stargazing90 : @catladyactivist So he entered and leaves through the basement? If so I wouldn’t def say yes. I’d probably still wear an N95 for an hour or so because I’m paranoid, but that’s me \\n@beccaimahere : @stargazing90 @catladyactivist Two guys came to the house to give an estimate. Warned to wear a mask over here. Had two N95’s for ‘em. Put them on like good dudes no problem. If they go home and share that issue with their fam, friends, office, I feel as though it’s free advertisement. So be it. \\n@stargazing90 : @beccaimahere @catladyactivist Def..I assumed she would have them N95 \\n@cutejewelryst : @catladyactivist If you can get fans in two windows (one in front,one in back) it will circulate more. We had the AC people come in through the back door but we left the windows open for a few hours iirc. But still mask ofc. \\n@69L46 : @catladyactivist I would try to have a fan blowing out the open basement door to the outside, and another blowing into the basement from the 1st floor. Then open 1st-floor windows, except for those on the same side of the house or downwind from the basement exhaust.\\n\\nAnd keep range/bath fans off. \\n@69L46 : @catladyactivist The idea is to have a well-defined air-flow pattern. However, if the appliance uses natural gas, you should use explosion-proof fans if possible. If not rated Class I Div I, then AC induction or brushless DC are non-sparking, but can get hot. \\n@69L46 : @catladyactivist You could put the fan in the doorway, and then use garbage bags and duct tape to cover the open areas in the door frame. Maybe add some vertical slits to make them easy to tear apart if emergency egress is needed. \\n@Prof_NickTalley : Bad news.

Cognitive dissonance 🤷🏽\\u200d♂️ \\n@DrCraigGedye : @TommyJohn00 The responsibility of getting health communications right is beautifully illustrated here - a cheap vaccine that is vastly more effective (on average) than an expensive monoclonal antibody.

I have given up arguing with these people \\n@DrCraigGedye : @TommyJohn00 I thought he wore glasses, not a monocle? \\n@jasonandrade : @TommyJohn00 Is it because they ended up in hospital because they were identified as vulnerable (and similarly, given antivirals for the same reason) but because their experience was mild - they can\\'t connect one thing to the other ? \\n@TommyJohn00 : @jasonandrade No they were very sick. But not sick enough to need a vaccine. \\n@jasonandrade : @TommyJohn00 I am with you then.

Also would mean that anyone with would still have to report it (which they don\\'t) - so unless people do all Test &amp; Report then there are no stats! \\n@blackoutpete : @laughingmonsta So for the past two years they have been no reports about the cove cases in Edinburgh?

That’s where the $$ is made … millions of workers rely on industry jobs. @BCRFA #restaurants #covid #inflation \\n@TrigoBruno : @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA thats a terrible idea. restaurants/hospitality businesses are some of the worst offenders when it comes to works rights! \\n@BradDirks : @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA I wholeheartedly agree! My son works in Vancouver at a popular restaurant, &amp; relies on his earning &amp; tips to live &amp; pay rent!!! When union workers have the luxury/privilege of job action, they should make sure other workers aren\\'t negatively affected. The optics are brutal 👎 \\n@ShibbyJames21 : @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA The restaurants are fine the LDB already set up a 3rd party delivery system for them \\n@CanKellyJ : @BradDirks @HamelHeather @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA A raise that is less than inflation amounts to a wage cut, or a loss of purchasing power \\n@KyleDaoust_ : @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Businesses are struggling, sure, but what about the workers? Do you forget why they’re striking in the first place? If the government had come forward with a fair offer this very limited job action wouldn’t be happening. \\n@VincyBrit2010 : @WDaveWatt1 @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Bonuses are nice but they don’t help when doing overtime, help w/ pension contributions, etc. Workers are better off getting “bonus money” added into wages. \\n@HamelHeather : @BradDirks @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA I said \"what amounts to a pay cut\".  Wage increases that don\\'t keep up with inflation mean workers fall further behind. #COLA \\n@bwilliams6009 : @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA They dont care about anybody but themselves, its called the union mindset. \\n@HamelHeather : @BradDirks @CanKellyJ @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA You can equate it that way, but why don\\'t you ask a wildfire fighter, a corrections officer, a social worker, or the LDB workers (who were called essential without the pandemic pay, andbring in needed $$ to prov for health care/ed) if they are in a yacht or drowning? \\n@GrahamPudek : @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Yes. I don’t know why the @bcgeu is not being considerate of these small business who also have many hard workers who are being negatively impacted by their selfish actions towards them. It’s not fair to punish those not responsible or directly involved in this dispute. \\n@GrahamDun : @BradDirks @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Union workers include nurses and other healthcare professionals. Do we not owe them a raise? Do we now owe them more than criticism? \\n@BradDirks : @GrahamDun @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Graham, I\\'m well aware that nurses are union members. My sister-in-law is a nurse. British Columbians like me can support wage increases for union workers, and still disagree with this job action that hurts those at the bottom trying to earn a living to pay tuition, rent, etc. \\n@GrahamDun : @BradDirks @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Agreed. I wanted to highlight nurses because they are our backbone to healthcare and our government is leaving them behind. Look to see what NFLD is doing as a province for nurses. @BCNDP is in denial. \\n@HamelHeather : @BradDirks @CanKellyJ @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Yes benefits are ok, but we have a long way to go. These folks aren\\'t millionaires. Some get much less than they would in priv sector, other provs, or feds. How about no wildfire fighters next yr b/c all go elsewhere? Vehicle inspectors, soc workers, prob ofcrs? Emp can/shld pay. \\n@BradDirks : @HamelHeather @CanKellyJ @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA I’m very familiar with all those talking points, sound bytes &amp; whataboutisms. As an entrepreneur who’s been self employed since 1994, I’m familiar with the vast differences between the public &amp; private sectors. I fully understand the unity of union employees. It’s nothing new. \\n@Sheremetaverse : @HamelHeather @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA This answer perfectly illustrates our Union movement. If we’re not happy, fuck everyone else. I support the restaurant industry. As a result of your actions, I do not support you. And i guarantee I’m not alone. \\n@HamelHeather : @Sheremetaverse @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Well these folks are paid to care about you, kids in care, prisons, wildfires, vehicle inspections, sales tax, etc. Too bad you don\\'t think they deserve a fair wage increase the province can afford. \\n@HamelHeather : @BradDirks @CanKellyJ @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA You call them talking points, I call them real life for thousands of your neighbours.  But then again, you would know that since you are such a big union supporter. \\n@HamelHeather : @BradDirks @CanKellyJ @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA you don\\'t get them so they shouldn\\'t? What do you get that they don\\'t? Why attack the worker for negotiating benefits? They had to give up other thgs to get them.  Employer still has HUGE piece of pie. They could stop job action with a fair offer. Ask yr MLA. BTW they get COLA. \\n@BradDirks : @HamelHeather @CanKellyJ @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA It’s possible to care about &amp; support unions overall, and still disagree sometimes with job action tactics that hurt small businesses &amp; their employees. As a server, my son &amp; thousands of workers like him are negatively impacted, and it’s “real life” for them just as much. \\n@BradDirks : @darilynnbutler @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Well said Darilynn. Restaurants and their staff who rely on earnings &amp; tips to pay rent, save for tuition, buy groceries, raise a family, and most with no job security, benefits, dental coverage, paid vacation time or pensions! \\n@JudyCMPhipps : @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA I wish the government would come to the table and make a meaningful offer to our members and then perhaps restaurants would not be in this situation. Email your MLA’s asking for the same! \\n@stenberg_jane : @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA I agree, Jody. This is not winning any public support and is totally dumping on the restaurant industry. They just look like bullies bullying the forever victims. \\n@ziggerman007 : @PDiespecker @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA The best bargaining chip is one that makes the other side take notice.  This will get lots of air time.  I don\\'t agree with the tactic, I\\'m just pointing out that it is one. \\n@shiploader1 : @bwilliams6009 @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA What an ignorant statement. Union workers want to raise everyone’s working conditions, benefits and the ability to earn a decent living. My unions motto is “An injury to one is an injury to all” \\n@shiploader1 : @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Just curious isn’t it the government imposing the limits? Pretty sure it’s not the union trying to create hardship on restaurant owners.

My comment wasn’t a reflection about strikes — it’s about the decimation of the BC restaurant industry, which is the province’s largest employer of young people and women. @BCRFA @iantostenson can explain. \\n@darilynnbutler : @moodyangela @BradDirks @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA I am in no way demonizing union jobs. I am suggesting the restaurant industry has suffered exponentially more than many in last 2 years so maybe they could get a break. Some places pay living wages but without products to serve they suffer. \\n@stenberg_jane : @moodyangela @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Having known a couple of small restaurant owners who went bust during COVID, I think you might be sweeping the whole industry with a broad brush. Maybe the big chains are guilty of this but small restaurant owners are small business owners and don\\'t have a big margins. \\n@HamelHeather : @jodyvance @suz2772 @bcgeu @BCRFA @iantostenson I don\\'t share your confidence that people know this is about low recruitment and retention in many jobs essential in this province. Not just about liquor. But again very easy to blame workers for striking instead of the Employer for not coming to table with a reasonable offer. \\n@jodyvance : @HamelHeather @suz2772 @bcgeu @BCRFA @iantostenson You’ve missed my point, completely. That’s ok though. Have a great night. \\n@HamelHeather : @BradDirks @CanKellyJ @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA So tell your MLA the negotiators should get back to the table.  They have the means to settle this. That\\'s where the best deals get done. \\n@jodyvance : @HamelHeather @BradDirks @CanKellyJ @bcgeu @BCRFA This is Twitter. I’m giving my opinion.

Great chat 👊🏻 \\n@shiploader1 : @moodyangela @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Thanks for this perspective 👍 As I rarely order a drink in a restaurant these days or frequent chain restaurants I prefer small restaurants and spend my alcohol money in the form of a tip \\n@HamelHeather : @BradDirks @CanKellyJ @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Your comments don\\'t exactly show respect for the Union workers you say you support. You think the solution is to get the workers to back off. Or not ask gor more in the first place. Sorry that it takes so much \"time\" to show any support. \\n@lcooke1916 : @moodyangela @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA And your solution is?

When you are striking you are lucky if you get a fraction of your wages. It also depletes the resources of the Union. If the restaurant industry is suffering they should lobby the gov for concessions for bcgeu \\n@Frankmtank : @stenberg_jane @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA They look like bullies? Did you see what they were offered? And that\\'s not a one off but successive contracts. The bullies are gov. Those on strike only make a fraction of their regular wage. They are suffering for their own futures. Lobby gov to give fair and reasonable offer \\n@PDiespecker : @ziggerman007 @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Touché \\n@stenberg_jane : @Frankmtank @jodyvance @bcgeu @BCRFA Just saying how it appears to me.  The gov bullies the union, the union bullies small business so they will pressure government and gain the union leverage. Guerrilla politics. \\n@RBAdvisors : #US had a savings surge during 2020’s #COVID lockdown that led to pent-up spending.

I accepted that I might not agree with them on all their decisions but emphasized many times that I thought we (i.e., @ucdavis) could do better in many areas 9/n \\n@phylogenomics : We discussed some of those issues too.

That is the real puzzling part to me. \\n@phylogenomics : @GrantAcosta5 @Chancellor_May @ucdavis I think it is unlikely but I certainly got the sense that chancellor would be open to considering it \\n@ls_pun_dit : @phylogenomics @Chancellor_May @ucdavis You had a DSLR on you? \\n@phylogenomics : @ls_pun_dit @Chancellor_May @ucdavis Heh. Always. \\n@hill0karen : @phylogenomics @Chancellor_May @ucdavis I honestly don’t understand how we no longer have many of the mitigations that were in place last year (indoor mask requirement, mandatory testing etc.) which were so effective at keeping students and faculty in class on a regular basis 🤦\\u200d♀️🤦\\u200d♀️ \\n@LichenBowels : @hill0karen @phylogenomics @Chancellor_May @ucdavis Education is a business. \\n@GrantAcosta5 : @LichenBowels @hill0karen @phylogenomics @Chancellor_May @ucdavis Yes, and a thriving business wants/needs it\\'s employees to be working.  So, it\\'s in the interest of UCD to keep it\\'s employees and students healthy. \\n@LichenBowels : @GrantAcosta5 @hill0karen @phylogenomics @Chancellor_May @ucdavis Unfortunately, no.

I’m afraid of that vaccine , let me know how you do. \\n@RonKlopfanstein : @michelemccarrol I’m afraid of the vaccine too TBH. But, every time I get overtired or overstressed I have a little shingles outbreak, so I figured I’d might as well take the plunge and do it. \\n@michelemccarrol : @RonKlopfanstein My Doc keeps offering it to me and so scared of getting sick , I had a small outbreak but I was sick with fever …well since your doing it …I think I’ll say yes in October my next ck up . \\n@RonKlopfanstein : @michelemccarrol I will let you know how it goes.

Still on meds for the permanent nerve damage it caused. My left arm is weak now, I sometimes struggle to lift heavy things with it etc. Still raging that the UK didn\\'t offer the chicken pox vaccine I could have avoided this all. \\n@RonKlopfanstein : @curexcomplex Wow. I’m glad I got the vaccine. The UK doesn’t vaccinate for chicken pox? \\n@curexcomplex : @RonKlopfanstein Nope. Which is unreal because if you prevent kids getting the chicken pox you stop them getting shingles in later life. Shingles vaccine is available to over 70s. Chicken pox was considered not cost effective to be added to routine childhood vaccination. \\n@RonKlopfanstein : @curexcomplex Wow. I’m surprised about that. Chicken pox is awful. It’s too bad people have to get it unnecessarily. \\n@JoannRossi3 : @miazga_s @michelemccarrol @RonKlopfanstein I’m so sorry!❤️one of my friends when she got her first round of shingle shot she got very sick .

They just went to high up on my arm. They call it SIRVA. They should not stand and give you injection if you are seated. It is more likely to be injected Into bursa and not muscle. \\n@michelemccarrol : @miazga_s @RonKlopfanstein That makes perfect sense … omg so you have a form of bursitis now ? \\n@miazga_s : @michelemccarrol @RonKlopfanstein Frozen shoulder. Lots of pain for a few months. Inability to dress/ put on coat without assistance. SLOWLY getting better. In the grand scheme of things… I can’t complain. I have not had shot 2 yet. \\n@michelemccarrol : @miazga_s @RonKlopfanstein That’s just terrible . But could happen with any injection ? Not just the shingles vaccine ? \\n@RonKlopfanstein : @michelemccarrol @miazga_s I am glad the pharmacist who injected me was sitting down. I never thought about that before. I never got vaccines the whole time I had CFS until I got the COVID vaccine. I don’t think I would get a flu shot though. It doesn’t seem worth the risk. \\n@michelemccarrol : @RonKlopfanstein @miazga_s Ive gotten the flu shot the last three years … no reaction at all . Shingles vaccine seems way more likely to cause you to be sick ! \\n@RonKlopfanstein : @michelemccarrol @miazga_s I wonder if we’ll need monkeypox vaccine soon? \\n@michelemccarrol : @RonKlopfanstein @miazga_s Omg say it isn’t so … how about polio boosters too ! \\n@RonKlopfanstein : @michelemccarrol @miazga_s Right. Jeez. All that stuff, even COVID, would probably be a thing of the past if not for anti-vaccine people. \\n@michelemccarrol : @RonKlopfanstein @miazga_s That’s the whole problem 😡 \\n@RonKlopfanstein : @michelemccarrol @miazga_s Yep. So true. It makes me so angry. \\n@michelemccarrol : @RonKlopfanstein @miazga_s These people that don’t understand “for the greater good” are selfish to the nth degree . \\n@miazga_s : @michelemccarrol @RonKlopfanstein Exactly!!!! One issue is the shingles vaccine is one of the few you can not get any compensation for post injection issues. The  parent company does not contribute to fund that handles SIRVA issues. Most other vaccine manufacturers set aside a small amount from each shot \\n@michelemccarrol : @miazga_s @RonKlopfanstein Wow how interesting ! \\n@RonKlopfanstein : @michelemccarrol @miazga_s I didn’t know that either. \\n@miazga_s : @RonKlopfanstein @michelemccarrol I did not know any of it until I had an issue. I have gotten many vaccines in my right arm since then in preparation for Guatemala trip. I get nervous every time. My shingles vaccination was in November 2021 in left arm \\n@michelemccarrol : @miazga_s @RonKlopfanstein Guatemala ! Holy cow , lots of pics please . Any special reason for this trip ? \\n@miazga_s : @michelemccarrol @RonKlopfanstein My daughter saw on TicTok a Volcano hike. You spend night up there. We were all going to go, but husband hurt knee. Daughter went. We (husband and I) plan to go in October . Side trip to Tikal to see Mayan Ruins https://t.co/dFUtcqL4k0 \\n@michelemccarrol : @miazga_s @RonKlopfanstein So beautiful ! You are very brave … I’m a Hilton room service kind of girl ! \\n@michelemccarrol : @miazga_s @RonKlopfanstein I’m going to Vegas in October , that’s almost the same … right ? 🤣 \\n@miazga_s : @michelemccarrol @RonKlopfanstein I’m a bit nervous. it is a hard hike. We will see🤪 \\n@michelemccarrol : @miazga_s @RonKlopfanstein I’ll be pulling for you 👍🏻 \\n@anmifis : @curexcomplex @RonKlopfanstein Not true. My youngest got chicken pox at 9 months which put him at higher risk of developing shingles before age 5, which I discovered when he developed shingles age 4 \\n@curexcomplex : @anmifis @RonKlopfanstein Thats literally what I just said, preventing kids getting the chickenpox prevents them getting shingles. The converse is true,  younger they get cpox the higher the shingles risk, this i mostly due to the fact their immune system is not fully developed until they\\'re about 2ish. \\n@anmifis : @curexcomplex @RonKlopfanstein Yes I realized I messed up but couldn’t figure out how to fix it \\n@curexcomplex : @anmifis @RonKlopfanstein The UKs choice not to vaccinate is insane, though theres not much of a push because people dont realise there is a vaccine. I had it at 4 months old, had singles twice. Really not worth the hundred quid or so the vaccine would have cost the system. Its a fallacy really. \\n@anmifis : @curexcomplex @RonKlopfanstein It’s surprising. Australia adopted it later than the US but it’s been on the schedule there for many years now \\n@canteach : So I’ve never been diagnosed with #Covid. No symptoms. Always tested negative.

Is there a way after 2 vaccinations and 2 boosters to tell if I’ve had it? \\n@FuzzyWuzzyTO : @canteach Oh dear, I’m sorry. I hope it’s quick and mild. \\n@canteach : @FuzzyWuzzyTO It may just be that I’m fat!! 😂 \\n@FuzzyWuzzyTO : @canteach Bah! \\n@deb_morris12 : @canteach There is an antibody test you can get to tell if you’ve had Covid. You can get it at the drug store or you can get an at home antibody test \\n\\nhttps://t.co/5a4VK7j591 \\n@canteach : @deb_morris12 Thanks!! \\n@canteach : @deb_morris12 Ordered a couple. \\n@ChristyCeeCK : @whosthatguurrrl @canteach I think the most important thing right now is the symptom. Causes can be figured out and it might very well be relatively innocuous but I would make an appointment. \\n@canteach : @ChristyCeeCK @whosthatguurrrl Thanks, everyone. I\\'ll be making an appointment! \\n@dianemariereid : @canteach Sounds more like asthma. \\n@canteach : @dianemariereid Oooh. Never thought of that. \\n@myrabatchelder : Our government could save lives from #COVID and #LongCOVID.\\n\\nAllowing uncontrolled large community spread is a policy choice. \\n\\nOur government is choosing not to put in place more COVID prevention policies. This in effect prolongs the pandemic. \\n\\nMore people should be angry. \\n@DissentFu : @myrabatchelder Its literally democide. Covid impacts low income households the most. \\n\\nI do not understand how/why we are all just accepting this. Especially now that kids are back in school. \\n@WrennHill : @myrabatchelder Question: if you inject yourself with mrna, which programs your cells to make spike proteins, how much spike is produced? More than the avg covid infection? How long do your cells make spikes? \\n\\nSpike Proteins are toxic to humans &amp; are rumoured to cause long covid. \\n@WrennHill : @DissentFu @myrabatchelder Speaking of kids, these vaccines are still in trial phase to test for safety amongst other things. \\n\\nHere\\'s Pfizer:\\nhttps://t.co/dFNAxkJNFm\\n\\nHere\\'s Moderna;\\nhttps://t.co/P0xrIHeC0g https://t.co/IDtF8wrP8C \\n@Renmarkable1 : @myrabatchelder sadly Australian government is now working hard at assisting covid .. \\n@myrabatchelder : Living in apartment building it\\'s amazing to watch how many more people wear a mask when there\\'s a sign posted on door saying \"Masks Required.\" \\n\\nSuch a simple thing like a masks required sign can save lives from #COVID &amp; #LongCOVID. \\n\\nMore spaces should take action to save lives \\n@SalingerGita : @myrabatchelder @BruceVConway Honestly, more and more I think that people (not the freedumb convoy people, just people) need a mask mandate to give them the EXCUSE to wear a mask. When a certain place requires or even just expects it, it happens. People need to be able to low grade complain: 1/2 \\n@SalingerGita : @myrabatchelder @BruceVConway \"Oh gods we have to wear a mask here, right\" as they put it on. Like people grumble about going to work on Monday. They don\\'t mean it. People don\\'t want to be unemployed when they say that. People don\\'t want to be sick. But we are a SOCIETY.  We need gov\\'t guidance. \\n@BruceVConway : @SalingerGita @myrabatchelder I was thinking, it\\'s all an IQ test.  Smart people will survive, because they know that masks work.\\n\\nThe deliberate not-wearing of masks is just another way of saying \"I\\'m stupid.\" \\n@SalingerGita : @myrabatchelder @BruceVConway 3/4 increasingly I feel we\\'ve lost the plot. We have it backwards. Covid precautions are to AVOID a \"lockdown\". Also those rules make it possible for someone who is not interested in Covid to do the right thing. I don\\'t care about seatbelts. I do it because society requires it \\n@SalingerGita : @myrabatchelder @BruceVConway 4/4 the ENTIRE point of govt making rules is to make the place liveable. The average citizen should be released from Covid concern by a sensible govt policy. Not, every man for himself. What are we? Lord of the Flies??? We need sensible rules. So we can think about other things. \\n@BruceVConway : @SalingerGita @myrabatchelder Yes, seatbelts are a good analogy. In a sense, also, it has to become our \"way of doing things\" from here on; \"something we do here\", to help each other. \\n@SalingerGita : @BruceVConway @myrabatchelder But it\\'s wrong. Uninformed people should live happily, too. And we\\'d all be happier if we could move on and not get sick and argue. Each person shouldn\\'t have to make a huge decision every time they leave their house. We need a govt policy that acknowledges WHERE WE ARE. \\n@SalingerGita : @BruceVConway @myrabatchelder I feel strongly we need public policy precisely so the uninformed and disenfranchised aren\\'t so angry all the time. I remember yelling at my phone when @fordnation said he wanted no rules so \"we wouldn\\'t have a divided society\". He\\'s not the brightest, and has that worked?  No. \\n@scott_squires : @SalingerGita @myrabatchelder @BruceVConway 60-70% of people open to masking before @CDCDirector destroyed that concept. Just in a nudge of a sign or a few others masking would get a few more to do so \\n@WrennHill : @myrabatchelder N95 masks aren\\'t even recommended for working with asbestos. If you\\'re really concerned about infection control, you should be wearing this: https://t.co/dusRu1ZGWt \\n@WrennHill : @myrabatchelder Question: if you inject yourself with mrna, which programs your cells to make spike proteins - How much spike is produced? More than the avg covid infection?

Your GP who was told that if they say anything negative about the vax they risk investigation &amp; possible de-registration? Great strategy. Good luck to you. \\n@Shoobydoowoo : @myrabatchelder @TogetherWeMask I really underestimated how many people need to be told what to do \\n@MsJulieSLam : @myrabatchelder @TogetherWeMask In my building, we lost a 39-year-old worker to #COVID, even then, the workers ignore the CDC\\'s recommendation of indoor masking. The second the mandate was lifted, the building became maskless. \\n@TogetherWeMask : @Shoobydoowoo @myrabatchelder Telling is not enough. The general public needs to be convinced. We need awareness. Science facts simplified and presented creatively to reach people of all ages. PSA on TV and social media over a long time. We need talented artists. Mandates alone won\\'t work! That\\'s the reality. \\n@leftyvegan : @Jerome34568655 @small4lyfe @GaryGoodson17 @tmprowell It\\'s not approved because it\\'s only been out a short while. Emergency use authorization is the first step in the approval process, &amp; is based on only the first 3 months of clinical trial data. Pfizer didn\\'t get full approval until 8 months after EUA, &amp; Moderna was almost 1 year. \\n@Jerome34568655 : @leftyvegan @small4lyfe @GaryGoodson17 @tmprowell I guess I’m questioning why the EUA: no one believes there is an “emergency” anymore. Even CDC doesn’t give updates anymore and they have totally relaxed restrictions. \\n@GaryGoodson17 : @Jerome34568655 @leftyvegan @small4lyfe @tmprowell I still think many people were fooled when Comirnaty was approved but made unavailable - at least in the US. The bait and switch. Now most have forgotten the distinction.\\nAnd most people still believe the media - that was given billions by Gates to print/state the party line. \\n@myrabatchelder : We are destroying ourselves by allowing #COVID to spread uncontrolled with no efforts to prevent transmission.\\n\\nPeople are just living in denial until they too get sick, and then they reach out to those of us already sick with #LongCOVID and ask for help. \\n@myrabatchelder : Every week it feels like someone else I know or am connected to reaches out about trying to find help for themselves or friend or loved one who now has serious health issues, hearing loss, brain problems, heart issues, had a stroke, got diabetes, +/or more after COVID. #LongCOVID \\n@sarnib05 : @myrabatchelder Hubby tested positive Saturday, forced to go to work or be fired. The rest of house became sick on Monday. It has been awful and kid is still pretty ill. Tests are still a strong positive. \\n\\nOne person in the house drops the ball, everyone goes down. 😷 are so important. \\n@myrabatchelder : @sarnib05 I\\'m so sorry. I hope you and your family all get better soon! \\n@sarnib05 : @myrabatchelder Thank you! \\n@myrabatchelder : And a note that a lot of people having health issues from #COVID and #LongCOVID are not sharing that info with most people in their lives! Just because no one you know has **has told you** they\\'re experiencing this, that does not mean that they aren\\'t. Stigma is horrible. \\n@MollieMthecat : @myrabatchelder I feel a lot of poor souls who will get long covid believe there is treatment plus a lot of people with long covid ask #pwme about treatment. Once you get chronic post viral , it\\'s usually down to on your own. \\n@bourbon8888 : @myrabatchelder Yes &amp; unfortunately they are seeking treatment that fixes them quickly. I don’t think most are ready for navigating &amp; tirelessly trying diff things that help including medical, lifestyle changes, diet, sleep.

After 6m wait colleagues &amp; I all hoped that once in I’d be given The Treatment. Everyone shocked to be told - nothing we can do. Just stop trying to work and rest. \\n@vic_yarrington : @MollieMthecat @myrabatchelder 1/2 I’d struggled on until then, working a few hours, getting worse &amp; worse, hoping to eke out sick pay until I got to clinic &amp; treatment. At start of clinic I was advised to stop work during treatment. Colleagues &amp; I assumed some rehab &amp; meds programme &amp; I’d be back in 6 weeks. \\n@Renmarkable1 : @vic_yarrington @MollieMthecat @myrabatchelder may I ask how are you going now? \\n@vic_yarrington : @MollieMthecat @myrabatchelder 2/2 no one knew what happened at the long covid clinics but we assumed cutting edge science. Met some colleagues after 6 weeks all asking ‘you better now, what was the treatment, new drug?’ (Note - we work in science) &amp; all very sobered to realise truth. There is nothing. \\n@vic_yarrington : @Renmarkable1 @MollieMthecat @myrabatchelder Thanks, some symptoms slightly better but some things continuing to get worse &amp; new symptoms appear.

A lot of people think government would surely require masks on planes if it was unsafe. \\n@mskathleenquinn : @Kat9593 @purplediscomove @myrabatchelder (or maybe they were recently infected and were surprised it was possible to get re-infected?

So my message to them is: PLEASE consider your vulnerable patients and keep 😷 mandatory in ALL areas now and throughout winter (Covid hangs around in corridors too!) \\n@DZephirine : @ELHopkins Bart\\'s, which is a Centre of Excellence for cancer and heart patients, has kept mandatory face masks and everyone is continuing to wear them in an atmosphere of safety and calm. \\nFor me as an immunosuppressed person, that\\'s what \\'excellence\\' means. \\n@kimisgubbed : @ELHopkins My thoughts entirely. It\\'s a shame @NHSGGC seem OK with so many maskless visitors and receptionists in Glasgow Royal Infirmary and Stobhill hospital. I\\'ve an appointment at the Queen Elizabeth on Monday and not expecting any better (you access outpatient dept through busy cafe)🙄 \\n@sarahsea : @kimisgubbed @ELHopkins @NHSGGC Agreed. I’m a regular inpatient in the QEUH; thankfully I haven’t needed to go in since they lifted the mask policy, but @NHSGGC should know that I’m living in fear of having to go back. I’m not even sure I could risk going into hospital right now, no matter how sick I was. \\n@LFCwisdoms : @ELHopkins I agree 100% that vulnerable patients should not be put at risk in a place that should be 100% safe!\\n\\nEverone is at risk in hospitals without masks not just the vulnerable. That\\'s the most important message. People need to protect themselves which in turn protects the vulnerable. \\n@ELHopkins : @LFCwisdoms Absolutely! \\n@ELHopkins : @kimisgubbed @NHSGGC Yes it’s not good at all. \\n@ELHopkins : @jo_woods11 @NNUH @nandwics 💯 It will help keep patient numbers down and catch up on the waiting lists. \\n@LittleGreyRab : @eBayGuarneri @ELHopkins Hi Both. Came across this research over the summer. We took Cetirizine plus a probiotic w/ Lactoferrin in it and all 4 of us were barely ill at all. Suggestion is the combination prevents replication..

We’ve taken great care not to mix with many people and seen few family/friends since this all began. The nurse taking her blood wasn’t wearing a mask. Complaint submitted🙄 \\n@sarahsea : @kimisgubbed @ELHopkins @NHSGGC It’s discrimination, quite honestly. Surely this is a breach of the Equality Act? Immunocompromised people are having totally unreasonable burdens put on us (and us alone) when trying to access vital medical care. How is that fair, equitable or “protecting the vulnerable”? \\n@ELHopkins : @sarahsea @kimisgubbed @NHSGGC It’s not at all fair! \\n@ELHopkins : @LittleGreyRab @eBayGuarneri 👋 Hi 😊 Thank you for this, that’s great! \\n@Lunar2822 : @ELHopkins We are all wearing masks on the ward I work on. \\n@ELHopkins : @Lunar2822 That’s good to hear Michelle 😊 \\n@ELHopkins : @AlexJTudor So sorry Alex, it’s so unfair and stressful enough to be unwell without the added concern from covid. \\n@ELHopkins : @DZephirine That’s fantastic!

Hope you get well soon! \\n@LittleGreyRab : @ELHopkins @eBayGuarneri What I haven’t bottomed out is if you really are preventing replication + a higher viral load - are you also preventing/reducing the long-term damage to your immune system that #Immunology Twitter are worried about re Variants 4 &amp; 5? You’d have to hope.. \\n@mjkitten1 : @ELHopkins Agreed, but please can we add GP Practices and Dentists too please! \\n@ELHopkins : @mjkitten1 Yes please!! I think dentists are one of the most crucial places. \\n@mjkitten1 : @ELHopkins I would personally like to go back to everyone having to wear masks everywhere! \\n@ELHopkins : @mjkitten1 Me too! What’s the big deal? If they then installed #CleanAir we could get cases down so we wouldn’t have to wear them all the time with really low cases. \\n@ProfessorIgnima : @ELHopkins @LCWF_TBK Seems like an awfully long shot considering what is now mainstream 😡 https://t.co/BEHa1b5Inx \\n@mjkitten1 : @ELHopkins This country has gone mad, and out of control.

Ultimately if people choose to get immunity the dangerous way by infection not a lot we can do. \\n@simon_gordon_ : @OldeNaturalist @profvrr Even worse imho is not even allowing under 5s to vaccinate and not allowing kids the first booster. And of course their delaying child vaccines in the first place. \\n@simon_gordon_ : @BruceSt22513754 @OldeNaturalist @profvrr The problem with a tax funded health service is rules made to fit available budget !

I\\'ve been wanting to hear from people who share their experiences lost Novavax. For me I had mRNA for first three and recent booster was Novavax \\n@AENAJ5 : @JuCaCh8 @ScottBL68 What’s the benefit of Novavax, please? \\n@resist_breathe : @AENAJ5 @JuCaCh8 @ScottBL68 Novovax addresses omicron variants. \\n@AENAJ5 : @resist_breathe @JuCaCh8 @ScottBL68 What’s the benefit of that over the Moderna bivalent? The latter is what I think will be offered here, where I live, later on this year. \\n@resist_breathe : @AENAJ5 @JuCaCh8 @ScottBL68 That’s beyond my knowledge. I would guess it’s good to get any of the updated ones. The US is only offering novo as a primary series. \\n@geekygenie : @ScottBL68 @mctd_support Glad to hear that! I’ve been waiting for Novaxx for two years. Not yet approved for boosters in the USA. ☹️ \\n@mctd_support : @geekygenie @ScottBL68 My husband and I are thinking about lying to get a Novavax series because personal responsibility. \\n@JuCaCh8 : @AENAJ5 @resist_breathe @ScottBL68 Novavax uses different technology. It has shown to be effective against all variants. It is suggested in other things I\\'ve read its efficacy is strong more broadly. There are people who had bad reactions to the mRNA vaccines that had no adverse reactions to Novavax \\n@JuCaCh8 : @resist_breathe @AENAJ5 @ScottBL68 Oh I didn\\'t know that. I am in Canada and we were allowed to get it as a booster here. Wish it had been available when I got the original series \\n@ScottBL68 : @AENAJ5 @resist_breathe @JuCaCh8 Novavax will continue to be effective against all variants, while the Moderna bivalent is targeting a specific subvariant, which is already obsolete. #Novavax #NVAX $NVAX #COVID #Vaccine \\n@tracy22485777 : @ScottBL68 @mctd_support I\\'m glad for you. However, for me, I’ll stick to mRNA. Many Best in class Scientists have warned me about the vector vaccines. My husband is a transplant pt. He takes audio immune suppressant drugs. There’s a minute chance for a live particle to get into the body. \\n@ScottBL68 : @tracy22485777 @mctd_support Novavax is not a viral vector vaccine. \\n@ScottBL68 : @AENAJ5 @resist_breathe @JuCaCh8 The new Moderna vaccine was developed to attack the BA.1 subvariant and so is already essentially obsolete. The Novavax vaccine has been proven to effectively attack all variants due to its technology, which mimics the common spike anatomy. #Novavax #NVAX $NVAX #COVID #Vaccine \\n@tracy22485777 : @ScottBL68 @mctd_support I know it\\'s a protein subunit vaccine I\\'m sure it\\'s great for many ppl. Just not for me. \\n@tracy22485777 : @ScottBL68 @mctd_support Let me explain I have a peculiar immune system. In 2017 I welcomed a flu vax. Two days later I was in the Hosp with swine flu. I almost died. The pharmacist swore no live virus, However, I found out there\\'s always a possibility... \\n@J4yGrant : @tracy22485777 @ScottBL68 @mctd_support So, to clarify, you took the injected (inactivated) version, not the nasal (weakened) version? Then they diagnosed you with swine flu infection at the hospital? And they were able to draw a direct connection to a nearly fatal infection being caused by your inoculation? \\n@J4yGrant : @tracy22485777 @ScottBL68 @mctd_support I can see why you\\'d be wary of the J&amp;J, et al- even though the adenovirus used is modified to not replicate, not contagious- but Novavax is not an inactivated virus vaccine, and it doesn\\'t enter your cells to produce S. protein. Its less invasive than either mRNA or viral vector. \\n@tracy22485777 : @J4yGrant @ScottBL68 @mctd_support Yes that\\'s what I was told. \\n@tracy22485777 : @J4yGrant @ScottBL68 @mctd_support I\\'m just following my doc of twenty years advice and Scientists that know me. It\\'s probably fine but I\\'m that one in 100,000 atypical person. If something can go wrong it\\'s always me. \\n@J4yGrant : @tracy22485777 @ScottBL68 @mctd_support Interesting... So that would mean there was an instance where the virus grown in the chicken egg for that vaccine dose was somehow overlooked and not inactivated. I feel like that should allow you some legal recourse. (Although I don\\'t know if its worth fighting.) \\n@molokaicreeper : @ScottBL68 Need it for my 16 y/o unvaxxed son.

(Of anything you\\'d inhale.)\\n\\nI can\\'t decide if my \"immunity\" is due to that, or if it\\'s connected to being radiated daily by a HUGE radar set for 15 months, and then being doused in PCB-laden oil at a later assignment.\\n\\nMaybe I glow in the dark? https://t.co/pm6i2Bipi3 \\n@LoriReneeFye2 : @azmomx10 Oooh ... but THEN, if we were found to have natural antibodies in our blood ...\\n\\nShades of *The Handmaid\\'s Tale* come to mind.\\n\\nMaybe I DO need to buy a gun.\\n\\n(Nah.

It’s a very uncaring attitude. \\n@convid_2020 : @ELHopkins @hephaistos_ai Can you show me the data that says 201 children died of Covid that DID NOT have underlying conditions. I\\'ll wait. \\n@SarahStev0 : @convid_2020 @ELHopkins @hephaistos_ai You know that underlying conditions are not always life threatening, yes? Things like diabetes which is easily managed? \\n@convid_2020 : @SarahStev0 @ELHopkins @hephaistos_ai I understand that but my statement was to show proof of 201 children who have died of Covid WITHOUT underlying conditions. If they have underlying conditions this would mean they died WITH Covid and not OF Covid. \\n@SarahStev0 : @convid_2020 @ELHopkins @hephaistos_ai No, it doesn’t. They died because of covid. Without it their underlying conditions wouldn’t have killed them, what with them not being terminal conditions. And even if you were correct, this means you’re perfectly ok with children dying younger than they need to. Shame on you. \\n@ProfessorIgnima : @ELHopkins how can not investing in air quality be justified?  it’s not political, it’s not toxic…I can’t fathom… \\n@ELHopkins : If you are fed up of constant #Covid cases in schools, please tweet at your MP or write to DfE asking for #CleanAir .

She very obviously takes her duty of care towards her constituents &amp; society extremely seriously (sarcasm intended). \\n@ELHopkins : @Kevbrown51 @drcarolinej 201 children have died from covid, this should be enough for more people to sit up and see this isn’t working. Over 570 staff have also died from covid. All children are at risk from #longcovid and there is an accumulative risk from reinfections. \\n@Kevbrown51 : @ELHopkins @drcarolinej How any MP or Dr can support having no mitigations in schools just astounds me. There are a good number of medics within HoC govt benches yet none of them stand up to protect not only the kids but society generally.\\nTheir attitude is disgusting &amp; criminal IMO. \\n@ELHopkins : @Kevbrown51 @drcarolinej I think they have bought into the ‘mild’ propaganda in some MSM. \\n@berylhs : @ELHopkins I have, awaiting a response, also emailed head of education and chairman of local authority ed comm twice - no response.

They said they were restrictive. What is restrictive about a Hepa air purifier sitting in the corner? Why are children and staff still suffering unnecessary infections. What will the long term consequences be? #CleanAir \\n@FionaGHarrison1 : @ELHopkins Totally agree Air Putifiers are a necessity, but please don’t put them in a corner, they don’t clean the air pushed in a corner. \\n@DrAnnRigbyJones : @FionaGHarrison1 @ELHopkins Agree, but often difficult in classrooms to have them in the ideal centralised position.

Children are not at risk from Covid, the efficacy of air purifiers is highly doubtful, but worst of all  they will increase CO2 emissions which is the biggest long term danger. \\n@ELHopkins : @cazhaz @wearethevgps Yes many parents are offering on here and being rejected. \\n@LFCwisdoms : @ELHopkins To be fair, when they say that these mitagations would be restrictive, what they mean is that they would restrict the virus spreading which is not what they want. They couldn\\'t give a shit about children\\'s health, that isn\\'t on their radar. \\n@cazhaz : @ELHopkins @wearethevgps I offered. They would’ve accepted it but I also think they would’ve stuck the machine in the corner\\n&amp; not used it or complained about the noise, hence I didn’t end up buying one for the school. Also Govt could offer funding for them - they’ve wasted money on so much other stuff! \\n@ELHopkins : @cazhaz @wearethevgps Definitely they could if they wanted to improve things. It just doesn’t suit their narrative. \\n@FollyGirlMaxine : @daveprescott11 @ELHopkins Yeah and we can always replace the teachers that we maim and kill in the meantime.

Listen to yourself and give your head a wobble. What total nonsense! It’s a cold! It’s not going to harm teachers. \\n@FollyGirlMaxine : @daveprescott11 @ELHopkins I\\'ll let my colleagues who have had strokes, heart disease and kidney failure following Covid infection know. They\\'ll be so relieved. \\n@PatCrosbie1 : @daveprescott11 @ELHopkins It is nonsense to say that children are not affected by covid. 200 children in the UK have died from it and thousands are suffering long covid. \\n@daveprescott11 : @PatCrosbie1 @ELHopkins The latest information from the ONS for England &amp; Wales covers 2020, but that was the height of the “pandemic”.

They wouldn’t print it if it wasn’t true. So tell me how they can estimate this. Did they offset it with lives lost from adverse reactions?  Did they include people dying from lack of medical attention during lock downs? How about suicide? Please don’t be so gullible \\n@silver_modern : @rosepoptosis @TorontoStar A math model can give you any number with the good price. Search for vaccine injury, you will be surprised. \\n@rosepoptosis : @silver_modern @TorontoStar you’re a statistician too? Multitalented! Epidemiologist AND a statistician.

Will peer reviewed scientific evidence change your mind, or will you keep believing something that isn’t true because you can’t change your mind with new evidence. \\n@silver_modern : @rosepoptosis @TorontoStar Science will test experimental vaccine on monkey before human, and if the side effect of a vaccine include death, that vaccine cannot be mandated. We don’t need corrupted and manipulated scientists. \\n@rosepoptosis : @silver_modern @TorontoStar That makes zero sense in the context of this conversation. \\n@Jeff14285213 : @vanishdoom84 @JoshDehaas @TorontoStar Use you common sense . How can they determine how many lives could be saved by a vaccine that doesn’t work?. Peer reviewed by the people who censored peer reviewed papers which show the the vaccine has failed.  The fact is yours is an estimate.  But even that can’t be proven. \\n@Jeff14285213 : @vanishdoom84 @JoshDehaas @TorontoStar Like I say no way can they back that up. It’s an estimate as if the vaccine actually works. \\n@Jeff14285213 : @JoshDehaas @TorontoStar How can prove that?  Show your scientific methodology \\n@Jeff14285213 : @rosepoptosis @vanishdoom84 @JoshDehaas @TorontoStar The modelling has been BS from day one. Remember the two weeks to flatten the cure. Remember the winter of death and sickness for the unvaccinated? Remember the.vaxed would not get Covid. 🤔 what they can do with the modelling.   Bottom line, more shots more chance  of hospital \\n@rosepoptosis : @Jeff14285213 @vanishdoom84 @JoshDehaas @TorontoStar 1. NOVEL coronavirus. Scientists learned about it in real time. The modeling hasn’t been BS because mitigation measures prevented the worst of it at first. Yes, it was hoped the vax would be a panacea, but the virus mutated. It’s still very effective for reducing HC impact. \\n@rosepoptosis : @Jeff14285213 @vanishdoom84 @JoshDehaas @TorontoStar That is also not the bottom line, it’s obvious you don’t have experience in data analysis. \\n@Jeff14285213 : @rosepoptosis @vanishdoom84 @JoshDehaas @TorontoStar But I do have common sense. https://t.co/X25yo1QqwS \\n@Jeff14285213 : @rosepoptosis @vanishdoom84 @JoshDehaas @TorontoStar By the way the scientist were warned  by other virologists, the virus was 1. Zoonotic and it would mutate 2. That the vaccine was leaky.  3. That the mRNA had never been used on people. Yes the same expert you talk of still censored the others because they didn’t agree. \\n@vanishdoom84 : @Jeff14285213 @rosepoptosis @JoshDehaas @TorontoStar None of that is related to the article I sent you.

I\\'m quite bad at biology (but pretty good at math). \\n@fucklongcovid : @bilitated_dee multiple levels of denial all stacked atop one another.. i swear i need to design the #COVID Denial Pyramid™️ \\n@fucklongcovid : @smaragdhi antigen tests often fail to identify people who are actually infected, a shortcoming the FDA acknowledges. “Positive results from antigen tests are highly accurate,” the FDA writes, “but there is a higher chance of false negatives, so negative results do not rule out infection.” https://t.co/meZXek0A1N \\n@fucklongcovid : @smaragdhi source ⬇️\\nhttps://t.co/ACYpdI9Zdu \\n@trailrunner402 : @SherylBR549 @fucklongcovid Fortunately for me, that is indeed true. If I catch COVID with all the precautions I am taking, there is zero hope for anyone.  No kids at home, no friend or family visits, N95 and eye protection 100% indoors, no take out, no restaurants. https://t.co/1wVI2Vh4SJ \\n@fucklongcovid : @trailrunner402 @SherylBR549 pollen dot com!! i too suffer from allergies 🤧 some have suggested a connection between #LongCovid &amp; atopy.. i think the jury is still out on that though. good luck staying #COVID free!! your vigilance is commendable (and should be the norm) \\n@69L46 : @smaragdhi @fucklongcovid I hate it that they essentially use this as motivation to avoid any mitigations. \\n@sarahksojourner : @fucklongcovid Youngest started school last week and now has a cough.  So far, two negative RATs from days 1 and 2.  Had a fever day 1 but now fine.  Didn’t test yesterday but thinking about testing again. \\n@69L46 : @smaragdhi @fucklongcovid The tests were designed to detect the protein that makes up the shell of the virus.\\n\\nIn theory, this protein is subject to much less evolutionary pressure to mutate as compared to the spike protein where most of the mutations are occurring. \\n@69L46 : @smaragdhi @fucklongcovid With PCR, you can multiply the signal (almost like a photo multiplier tube). With RAT, I suspect that the location of the max viral load (nose vs throat) and difference in sampling technique is the leading cause of RATs missing positive cases. \\n@fucklongcovid : @69L46 @smaragdhi very interesting, thank you! stupid question - has anyone proposed or demonstrating any competing methodologies that could be applicable in a home test sort of application? \\n@69L46 : @fucklongcovid @smaragdhi I\\'ve seen home tests that are supposed to be something between a home RAT and a lab PCR. But these are mondo-expensive &gt;$40ea. I don\\'t recall how they work, though.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen SBIR solicitations for real-time detection of SARS2 in the air, but that would be a few years away. \\n@fucklongcovid : @sarahksojourner ugh. i\\'m so so sorry.. #COVID or not i don\\'t recall getting sick my first week back at school in all my years. i guess the real question is do you expect the rapid to give you a fair &amp; accurate reading? \\n@fucklongcovid : @69L46 @smaragdhi crazy!! thank you for all your insight! should we be taking wagers on when the government announces all those free rapids they sent us are bunk and we should throw them out? or would they prefer we just keep using them and testing (false) negative.. for safety theater\\'s sake? \\n@sarahksojourner : @fucklongcovid I know that RATs have been taking a long time to turn +.  Hoping it is allergies? https://t.co/sudrGWs2Nf \\n@fucklongcovid : @sarbarella nooooo!! i swear these variants each have their signature sound.. early on it was the deep, wet coughs and now it\\'s the aggressive sneezing. either your workplace got really dusty in the last few years or...... \\n@SherylBR549 : @fucklongcovid @trailrunner402 I just found out that the lovely green weeds in my yard is ragweed. 🤣 \\n@longcovidgf : @bilitated_dee @fucklongcovid the worst part about this for me is when i hear \"i just have a cold!!\" from someone i assume they already have tested. nope. not usually true. \\n@fucklongcovid : @sarahksojourner i hope so too!! the fever though 🤔 \\n@fucklongcovid : @longcovidgf @bilitated_dee \"i just [assume i] have a cold!!\" \\n@Toonces13451094 : @fucklongcovid 15 and all negative. The tests are worthless. \\n@fucklongcovid : @Toonces13451094 damn. that\\'s some dedication right there. i\\'d suggest to get a PCR but \"good\" news.. they too are semi-useless at this point! \\n@trailrunner402 : @SherylBR549 @fucklongcovid LOL!  Every time I start sneezing, I check the pollen count.  100% of the time, it’s above 8.5.  Bingo.  But I can’t tell you how many RATs I did just to be absolutely sure!  I also had the distinct side effect of…. \\n@trailrunner402 : @SherylBR549 @fucklongcovid ….sniffling and throat clearing and coughing and sneezing behind my N95 in the grocery due to this - and I learned that no one F-s with me in that circumstance.  Lightbulb moment 💡!  How NOT to get harassed for wearing my mask!!! 😜 \\n@fucklongcovid : @trailrunner402 @SherylBR549 but but but.. i thought it was just a mild flu??! 😵\\u200d💫 \\n@SherylBR549 : @trailrunner402 @fucklongcovid Keep wearing your mask! 🌻 \\n@SherylBR549 : @fucklongcovid @trailrunner402 You must be acquainted with my family. Unvaxed Niece and baby had Covid 2 weeks ago. Saw a photo of my mom with them unmasked. If hearing about my #LongCovid for 2 years isn’t a deterrent I don’t know what else to do. They want to come visit me- nope. \\n@fucklongcovid : @sarbarella ugh. reallllly hoping you managed to dodge reinfection! i think we all need these for such occasions henceforth https://t.co/THHYyKaoKK \\n@trailrunner402 : @SherylBR549 @fucklongcovid Totally understand!  Your family IS my family!  I am sure of it!  Father died of COVID, mother now has COVID.  All unvaccinated, FL DeSantis fans.  Can only imagine what comes next.  Haven’t seen them since Jan 2020. \\n@SherylBR549 : @fucklongcovid @trailrunner402 Poor us! I’ve tried everything but they don’t care. \\n@trailrunner402 : @SherylBR549 @fucklongcovid How does the saying go?  When the student is ready, the teacher appears. \\n@SherylBR549 : @trailrunner402 @fucklongcovid I’m so sorry about your dad, and your mom. I don’t understand it. \\n@SherylBR549 : @trailrunner402 @fucklongcovid They won’t be ready for a teacher until it’s too late \\n@trailrunner402 : @SherylBR549 @fucklongcovid We are seeing the worst of human nature.  When humans can’t deal with uncertainty, they make up absolutes to self soothe.  Unfortunately, the absolutes they are clinging to are abjectly false. \\n@trailrunner402 : @SherylBR549 @fucklongcovid Yep.  Too true. \\n@SherylBR549 : @trailrunner402 @fucklongcovid Aptly said. \\n@lbrownster : @fucklongcovid I’ve had COVID 3x (yup, I’m vaxed and boosted) and I no longer test positive on rapid antigen tests. Only PCR 🤷🏼\\u200d♀️ . First #COVID19 infection 11/23/20 and #LC since 4/3/2021 \\n@BaronMunc : @fucklongcovid Ahh yes… the traditional August cold… during a pandemic \\n@fucklongcovid : @BaronMunc makes perfect sense! \\n@bilitated_dee : @longcovidgf @fucklongcovid agreed! \\n@fucklongcovid : @SherylBR549 @trailrunner402 indeed!!! @trailrunner402 nailed it! \\n@fucklongcovid : @trailrunner402 @SherylBR549 so sorry about your father &amp; now your mother. i hope she makes a full and speedy recovery ❤️ i can\\'t imagine what it must feel like watching this play out in realtime. so much wtf \\n@fucklongcovid : @lbrownster damn. i\\'m so sorry ❤️ have you looked into the reasoning behind this? i have heard it mentioned.. something about \"seroconversion\" i do believe. freely admit i may have it confused with another concept. stupid #LongCovid brain damage \\n@fucklongcovid : @sarbarella never seen it. it looks.. interesting! \\n@fucklongcovid : @sarbarella i will have to check it out.. thank you! still haven\\'t seen six million dollar man either \\n@lbrownster : @fucklongcovid CT scan showed #LC caused swelling in my brain 🧠 in the Hippocampus which regulates emotions and memory—among other things.  I went to #SRAL for OT and SLP and did TMS with little success. As you know, every Dr. just says “it is going to take time” \\n@narstyfakker : @fucklongcovid I have a wicked flu with headache fever and chills sore throat ect.. tested negative with an at home Rapid test 🙄 \\n@sarahksojourner : @fucklongcovid Retested this morning - day 5 negative- youngest feels fine but still has intermittent cough \\n@fucklongcovid : @lbrownster damn. i\\'m so sorry ❤️ a lot of these acronyms are greek to me but i\\'ll research them when my brain is something other than a mostly useless inhabitant of my skull. sounds like you have better doctors than me! mine love to say things like \"oh, that\\'s perfectly normal\" 😔 \\n@fucklongcovid : @CharityFeb how much is the CDC paying you? 😛 \\n@fucklongcovid : @narstyfakker nooooooooo!!!! i\\'m so sorry. are you going to bother trying to get a PCR (which comes with its own risk of infection) or just isolate and ride it out? i really hope you feel better soon ❤️❤️❤️ \\n@fucklongcovid : @sarahksojourner feeling fine is great! cough not so much. so much uncertainty! hopefully they keep feeling better &amp; better https://t.co/9c3y4FFtce \\n@narstyfakker : @fucklongcovid I think the hospital is one of the only places to get an accurate PCR test, and the risk of sounding stupid… what do you mean the test has risks of infecting? \\n@fucklongcovid : @narstyfakker oh, i meant exactly what you\\'re describing.. going to hospital / urgent care / drugstore full of sick people. not work the additional risk imho but some people need to know if they\\'re positive so they can inform their employer, etc'"

Lead us not into #climatecatastrophe, but deliver us from #GlobalWarming! https://t.co/ct0Ma8rPkE \\n@ClimateChangeC_ : @USA2_0 Because of all the new coal-fired plants, the CO2 and HEAT are not going away. The entire CO2 approach is rendered (de facto) useless.\\n\\nBut I believe I have a real, patented, workable solution to Global Warming.  \\n\\nhttps://t.co/Penq0P3i52\\n\\nPlease take a look.  Click for sound. https://t.co/V8d3tesmYb \\n@USA2_0 : @ClimateChangeC_ This makes no sense to me.  Your emitter panel seems like a simple furnace that emits heat.  The heat would warm the surrounding air although some would escape by radiation.  Why would a significant portion of heat get radiated away from earth?  That needs explaining. \\n@ClimateChangeC_ : @USA2_0 Thanks for responding.  If you look closely at the video and read:\\n\\nhttps://t.co/gTxyI9rdAt\\n\\nYou will see that the emitter “enclosure” is insulated for both conduction and convection heat losses to surroundings. \\n@USA2_0 : @ClimateChangeC_ Doesn\\'t explain WHAT it emits or how/if that emission somehow sneaks past the atmosphere instead of just creating hot air. Anyway, why not just USE the energy from the battery that u removed from the incoming radiation? How is this different from a mirror? \\n@ClimateChangeC_ : @USA2_0 Yes, the idea is that the “controller” would regulate the temp of the plate so the frequency is within the optimal range for longer during the night.\\n\\nThe mirror and other (more elaborate) daytime approaches have their own issues.\\n\\nMy nighttime approach is a different idea. \\n@USA2_0 : @ClimateChangeC_ Interesting, but obviously the effectiveness has to do with many details.  IF you can EFFICIENTLY radiate heat completely off the planet, it\\'s a very interesting concept. \\n You need to have a detailed writeup available to link to.   If/when u do, I\\'d love a link. \\n@ClimateChangeC_ : @USA2_0 Thanks for responding.\\n\\nDid you have a chance to read:\\n\\nhttps://t.co/Penq0P3i52\\n\\nAnd, of course, it is patented. \\n@USA2_0 : @ClimateChangeC_ Yes, but I don\\'t have any way to know how much of the radient heat given off by the panel will sneak out of the atmosphere and actually get to space and how much will get absorbed by the atmosphere along the way.  It sounds like you think it will all get out.  No evidence. \\n@ClimateChangeC_ : @USA2_0 I don’t think all will get out, but since the emitter can be controlled, I believe much will.  If the emitter wasn’t there, then the radiant transfer would be from the ground below it, which would cool. The controller will keep it hot for as long as possible. \\n@ClimateChangeC_ : @USA2_0 Early days. Time will reveal it. Thanks for response. \\n@USA2_0 : @ClimateChangeC_ No doubt SOME will get out.  I guess you think most will.  I doubt it, but you need to find out &amp; maximize what % to see if it\\'s cost effective.

It is hot in summer. So, we should subsidise energy sources that are good when the Sun shines and the wind blows, but not otherwise. \\n@jacobotweetsnow : 4/What we need (IMHO) is investment in developing an efficient/cheap means of storing energy for when the wind don’t blow and the Sun don’t shine.

They expect ambitious actions from the @_AfricanUnion &amp; its member states. #LeaveNoOneBehind https://t.co/KITx44Oxju \\n@meganranney : Remember when people accused #climatechange scientists of being “alarmist”? https://t.co/HJma47x7dD \\n@geneseedreams : @meganranney We are right and truly f***ed. \\n@crossjacktar : @meganranney That pic is shocking, but the Loire has not evaporated. That is a channel one side of an island, the main river is the other side. Still bad. \\n@BillJonez1 : @meganranney What is missed by the general public is how guarded /conservative scientists are in coming to conclusions.\\nClimate change is accelerating much faster than the conservative scenario spoken about the last few years. \\n@JeromeAdamsMD : @meganranney I remember a lot of things. About climate change, covid, and number of other situations when people were called alarmists. Unfortunately there’s never a mea culpa (and it doesn’t matter in hind sight anyway)… \\n@WeRBeingPlayed : @JeromeAdamsMD @meganranney Sounds like the world needs a Great Reset \\nDon\\'t you think? \\n@JonathanFoulds : @meganranney This is Swatara Creek in Central PA. Lowest I have ever seen it. I wonder how many rivers are drying up across the world? https://t.co/smFANDJR1i \\n@The_Jerf : @JeromeAdamsMD @meganranney This is also the Loire. Taken about 6 weeks ago. Maybe you should clarify a “portion of the Loire” https://t.co/S4Z0gxqLum \\n@quorlia : @crossjacktar @meganranney There were places where the Dreisam in Freiburg appeared to be dry but I think it was running under the rocks. The channels in the city were pretty much all empty. \\n@crossjacktar : @quorlia @meganranney Rivers are very low across Europe, reducing navigation in important rivers like the Danube, but the Loire is still there, just much lower. Several rivers in the UK are now shorter than they were as their sources move down stream. \\n@davidsteele9000 : @meganranney Yeah, either it was today or yesterday. \\n@facts1st2020 : @meganranney The climate has changed throughout the history of planet Earth. \\n@vendro2000 : @meganranney I remember when climate alarmists didn’t, and still don’t, have any hard evidence that humans have much effect on the climate. \\n@vendro2000 : @meganranney I also remember when half of North America was covered by ice.  Somehow it all melted with any human intervention.  How can climate possibly get warmer without humans being responsible? \\n@vendro2000 : @meganranney Under the heading of “I bet you didn’t know”. You can check my math. \\n\\nCO2 accounts for .037% of our atmosphere.  Of the .037%, humans account for at most 5%.  One major volcanic eruption would dwarf anything humans produce.  Of that 5%, the U.S, contributes around 11%.   So….. \\n@vendro2000 : @meganranney …for the sake of attempting to reduce 0.0002% of the world’s CO2, some in our govt are willing to spend 100’s of billions of dollars of our money, lose our energy independence and increase our out of control inflation. \\n@HansaBhargavaMD : @meganranney @BenjamminGold Sigh.

Got it. \\n@MrBargill2019 : @meganranney Shows that  Mad Max is not too far fetched eh? \\n@Jiggypeters1 : @StevenMWinkler @meganranney Ummm. That’s all they do is cause panic. They don’t show it because it’s not the right time politically. They’ve done nothing but run cover for their preferred politicians. They will turn the volume up around election time. \\n@Jiggypeters1 : @BillJonez1 @meganranney They are guarded because dissenting opinions get shit on and defunded. They have been since Obama’s 97% lie. \\n@BillJonez1 : @Jiggypeters1 @meganranney Sorry don\\'t buy that argument.

Certainly doesn’t look like they get to walk on fresh green pastures \\n@enn_nafnlaus : @RoryMcEwan3 @on_tesla @MikeHudema As a vegetarian (not a vegan), I want a world where animals are treated well their whole lives and not prematurely terminated when they stop being productive. And I\\'m absolutely willing to pay more to have such a world. \\n@HowanCheng : @MikeHudema Is that why free range or cage free is more important than grass fed? \\n@morningsymes : @MikeHudema That is one of the most depressing things I\\'ve seen in my life. With whats going on currently that takes some beating. \\n@CryptoB37280669 : @MikeHudema god \\n@Chaviva9 : @MikeHudema I wonder the animals themselves know this is wrong. \\n@abarroown : @MikeHudema yeah that\\'s not on... \\n@WomanEngland : @MikeHudema Awful. Just awful. \\n@Lolahxoxo74 : @MikeHudema We\\'re all connected, even if we don\\'t like it.  We\\'re part of the same tapestry.  Came from the same primordial lake.  When we do harm to another, we do harm to ourselves.  That\\'s the prevailing message I hear in my head over &amp; over again.  When we harm others, we harm ourselves. \\n@citizencaitlin : @MikeHudema I learnt this years ago through a film called ‘ Food Incorporated’ it’s shocking. Please please if you do eat meat. Eat less!! And cows who are milked; the cruelty involved in this is unbelievable. At least with meat the animal is dead. But 4 years of torture ?! Horrific \\n@jugheadisme : @MikeHudema This is bad.. \\n@perburstrom : @MikeHudema Disgusting! :( \\n@billdill1691 : @MikeHudema Sick!😷 And yet if I go vegan,what am I getting.\\nIs it real,or👀 genetic,good or☠️ poison. \\n@KimMenounos : @jeenee05361820 @PoppaWheelieOG @MikeHudema Sadly most people just don’t give a crap about the welfare of these animals, nor the climate impacts of raising this many of them to feed insatiable yet luxurious appetites \\n@TomHurtado : @Wokeistan @on_tesla @MikeHudema @enn_nafnlaus 🤣🤣🤣 wow. Someone did their research. \\n@TopClimateTweet : @MikeHudema Congratulations!

That a torturous feed lot that should be CRIMINAL 😭😤 \\n@cloppyhorse : @WellsSimon80 @MikeHudema I grew up on a small farm. Nice open pasture for the cattle and a big open yard for the chickens. And they were treated kindly until the day they died. Almost as pets. Which made us a little sadder when it was their time, but made for a better life for them. \\n@Suesea123 : @on_tesla @MikeHudema @enn_nafnlaus If you think that somehow redeems this.. check your cold, deluded heart for signs of life.

I do not support it with my wallet or body. So can you if you choose to. Just like that \\n@skynetazul : @MikeHudema poor animals 👎🏻what kind of life is that 😢 \\n@cloppyhorse : @WellsSimon80 @MikeHudema I\\'m guessing they were less aware of their impending death than say a child in a cancer ward. Quality life and a quick death are the only decent way \\n@ClaraLAldana : @MikeHudema Thanks for sharing and for making this known. It is horrible and unnecessary. \\n@WellsSimon80 : @cloppyhorse @MikeHudema Well as a vegan I suggest the whole practice is unnecessary.  I am perfectly healthy and have not contributed to any loss of life or any animal farming practices in over 5yrs now. \\n@nerysofchi : @MikeHudema This is disgusting and not what I consider farming. \\n@RicardoCastroN5 : @Lejanaysola @MikeHudema Well, this statement is very generic and does not reflect the great preservation of the Amazon rainforest. \\n@RicardoCastroN5 : @Lejanaysola @MikeHudema Recently, in May and June, I traveled through the region.  More than 20,000 km were covered in off-road vehicles, ferries and canoes.  I observed a forest in an excellent state of preservation and with the inhabitants of the region very involved with the environmental issue. \\n@RicardoCastroN5 : @Lejanaysola @MikeHudema In Brazil it is possible to fly over the Amazon rainforest over a greater distance than the distance between Lisbon and Moscow. \\n@RicardoCastroN5 : @Lejanaysola @MikeHudema Recently, new isolated peoples who had never had contact with the “said” civilization were identified.  Where in the world is this possible? \\n@RicardoCastroN5 : @Lejanaysola @MikeHudema The Amazon is in a country that, despite having technology and uranium reserves, signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  It refrained from manufacturing and having the greatest threat - nuclear weapons - that the planetary environment can have. \\n@RicardoCastroN5 : @Lejanaysola @MikeHudema However, it cannot be denied that there are pressures on the Amazonian borders, not in the heart of the forest but in the contact of the Amazon biome with other Brazilian biomes. \\n@RicardoCastroN5 : @Lejanaysola @MikeHudema It is necessary to reinforce some controls, but it is necessary to understand that controlling the irregular entry and use of the forest by a few is extremely difficult. \\n@RicardoCastroN5 : @Lejanaysola @MikeHudema Just think about the American difficulties in controlling the border with Mexico, the difficulties they had in Vietnam and having a pale comparison with the total control of the Amazon. \\n@Elallinir : @MikeHudema ....this is what awaits us if we don\\'t do something now!😓 https://t.co/tc0oK4xezp \\n@RicardoCastroN5 : @Lejanaysola @MikeHudema It also serves as a comparison of the European difficulties in the prevention, control and mitigation of recent forest fires.  This is in a tiny region compared to the Amazon and full of roads that would facilitate government actions. \\n@RicardoCastroN5 : @Lejanaysola @MikeHudema But the best explanation that can be given about the Amazon is by encouraging people to come to know it.  Visit Manaus, Santarém or Belém.  Discover Anavilhanas and navigate the large rivers and igapós. \\n@zwitterio : @MikeHudema Where is this farm? \\n@BookofBogan : @Awerm974 @MikeHudema I agree it\\'s barbaric, but it has nothing to do with the issue of climate change. \\n@Awerm974 : @BookofBogan @MikeHudema cow fart, their fart is a big pollution \\n@Awerm974 : @BookofBogan @MikeHudema they also use a lot of water (to grow what they eat &amp; drink) in france &amp; europe we have very big drought. So reduce meat comsuption mean more land to grow vegetables for us, more water, use less space, less polution, better health(w/ replacing meat with more vegetable). \\n@JfitbestBest : @MikeHudema immoral \\n@1WorldChristine : @MikeHudema @sorenande If this is progress… I think we should all be ashamed at just how little regard we have for life … this is #inhumane this is not #Farming  #husbandry we have a responsibility to say no - this is not the future we want 😢 \\n@rahamdan : @MikeHudema I’ve visited many dairies, this is not the norm at all. Cows need comfort to produce milk. \\n@BLorraineSmith : @MikeHudema @lmmkelley People need to take time to understand context, options, e.g. @judithdschwartz detailed, journalistic books, among others.\\n\\nI am as concerned about life-destroying industrial broccoli as beef (+ reactionary media, too).\\n\\nInvest in/ingest life supporting food. \\n\\nNot sure?

Never eaten.  Maybe even more than that. \\n@baobei2000 : @KimMenounos @jeenee05361820 @PoppaWheelieOG @MikeHudema Most people on the planet don\\'t own a home or any land to grow their own food and raise chickens, sheep etc. Most people don\\'t have the financial flexibility to choose organic and free range consistently.  Our political and business leaders are responsible for this,not consumers \\n@baobei2000 : @jeenee05361820 @PoppaWheelieOG @MikeHudema Well said!\\nAlthough paying more often means double in Australia. And a tight family budget can\\'t always resist the cheaper meat products compared to organic and free range. \\n@Michael03401860 : @MikeHudema Not all hand-wringing bunny huggers are worth listening to. \\n@DefenceSky : @on_tesla @Wokeistan @MikeHudema @enn_nafnlaus Fact check before posting. These are dairy cattle not feeders. Cattle raised for meat don’t use pens of this type. \\n@pitlanepenny : @MikeHudema @wendy_troost Industrial farming of this type, along with damage to soil is why we’re ultimately doomed! \\n@HenaHongNam : @CayLibrary @Casey_Bretti @MikeHudema Dairy farm with out milking machines?\\nI think those are beef on your plate. \\n@jille3832 : @MikeHudema Animal agriculture is destroyed the planet. \\n@RealScience2020 : @ElBarbas420 @MikeHudema Oh yeah, nothing could go wrong there.  How many people won’t take vaccines? Do you think they’re going to trust a lab to “grow meat”? \\n@delomba666 : @MikeHudema Ceci devrait être visible depuis satellite sur Google Earth.

When you think animals are just something you can exploit for money and don\\'t realize you are fed from them and you are a part of that animal. \\n@FunSizedBryce : @on_tesla @MikeHudema @enn_nafnlaus They are trapped there for life because they\\'ll be killed in a few days, that\\'s where they keep the male baby cows for a short time. They kill them as babies and sell them as \"veal\" \\n@Barbara90904486 : @MikeHudema So who supposedly let’s all these cows out and who supposedly puts them all back in these cages.

It costs about $20 to \"fill it up\" so as long as I\\'m driving less than 6 hours a day, I never have to worry about how long it takes to charge.\\nOn road trips, it takes 15 minutes to charge for 5 hours of driving and costs @ $15 to go from 20 to 80%. \\n@Stephen85521174 : @SandyXiaotong Zero minutes-it\\'s fully charged when I get out of bed every morning. Never have to stand out in the rain or sun, never get my shoes covered in crap standing in a pool of diesel. Never arrive with my hands smelling of petrol. Never arrive late because I had to stop for petrol. \\n@SandyXiaotong : @Stephen85521174 You’re not one of those people that think you can drive around in an electric vehicle with an extension lead plugged into a power point are you? \\n@IanMcMi38908747 : @JStabbington @StrayDog67 @SandyXiaotong Have to ask Bowen on that one. \\n@IanMcMi38908747 : @GeoffPAus @GGandjmobile @SandyXiaotong Commercial hydrogen is at least 10 years away. We need a reliable power grid to produce it. \\n@Stephen85521174 : @SandyXiaotong And never have to drive around looking for the cheapest price because I charge it overnight off-peak, at fraction of the cost of petrol \\n@grappysb : @SandyXiaotong @vickiecheryl1 A Tesla takes longer.....much ....much ...longer \\n@JC47053522 : @DClay49 @GrocottGrocot1 @SandyXiaotong I don\\'t have a Tesla , but it sounds like BS.\\nRead reviews by owners on various sites and this was typical https://t.co/GJXHA7RFNm \\n@JC47053522 : @GeoffPAus @StrayDog67 @SandyXiaotong Where are you getting your info from ?

Pure Gold is 99.9% that\\'s 0.1% not Gold.  The impure portion of pure Gold is 2.5 times larger than the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.  CO2 in a greenhouse makes plants grow exuberantly, they in turn release even MORE Oxygen. \\n@T_Marie_Wms : My first day as a #college #professor!
